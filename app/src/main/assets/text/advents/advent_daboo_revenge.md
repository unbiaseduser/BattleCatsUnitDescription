# Dead by Encore > March to Death

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with a few Metal One Horns for cash. About a minute in, Daboo spawns, accompanied by some Metal Doge. Metal Doge continue to deploy throughout the stage at a gradual rate. Eventually, a couple Super Metal Hippoes spawn, followed by a Sir Metal Seal after some more time. The combination of Metal enemies and Omni Pushers is very lethal, and this stage is a prime example of it.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Crazed Moneko** - Crit Up M combo raises crit rate of your attackers by 2%, which is very helpful.
-   **Waitress / Soba** - Deals solid damage to the Sir Metal Seal, and also to Super Metal Hippoe. Guaranteed crit is also valuable here.
-   **Puppetmaster / Mochi** - Disposable CC. Enemies will push like hell without them.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Cameraman** - AoE Crit can be humongously helpful for the Super Metal Hippoes. A crit from Cameraman can take off anywhere from 60% [at level 40] to 100% [at level 69] of the SMHs HP.
-   **Noodle** - Good ranged meatshield, occasionally kills Metal Doge.
-   **Catyphoon** - Great for clearing up Metal Doge, but the cooldown is rather long.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Critical Hitters:** Paladin, Hayabusa, Nanaho, Lufalan Pasalan.
-   **Anti-Metal Tankers / Proc:** Poseidon, Sakura Sonic, Gudetama Machine.

Crit Up combo is pretty much compulsory to get Cameraman crits. Manic Jamiera can be substituted for Bahamut, but both are decent. Holy Blast is ideal for this stage, unless you have a levelled Waterblast for whatever reason. Catasaurus is also a functional critter, but not really recommended here. Alternative approach with talented Riceball is seen [here](https://youtu.be/mWjL5ml-zhs).

Start off with Waitress, then send Crazed Moneko after a bit of a delay. Afterwards spam Manic Eraser and Noodles, along with Catornado. These should take care of the Metal One Horns and bring in some money. Try to get Manic Jamiera / Awakened Bahamut in before the Super Metal Hippoe arrive to deal some damage to Daboo.

When the SMH arrives, stop spamming Noodle and Catornado, as they'll only prolong the fight. Waitress and Cameraman will be reliable, and no harm in sending CMoneko along with them. Send Puppetmaster and / or Mochi for Crowd Control, and try and time your faster units. If you're lucky, you'll land a Cameraman crit and make the fight much easier. Try to use a well-timed Holy Blast here to buy you some time.

For the Sir Metal Seal phase, you'll probably be fighting real close to your base. This is okay, and it makes timing a bit easier too. Cameraman isn't super reliable here, but if you have the money you can send her anyway. Waitress will be a consistent source of good damage, and you can always try your hand with C. Moneko [and even regular Moneko] here. This is a "Do or Die" sort of situation so you want to send everything you got.

Once the SMS is dead, you should have a clear win. Bringing Rich Cat is mandatory for this stage, and Sniper is helpful for the cleanup [but far from needed]. Unfortunately, this stage is _very heavily_ RNG dependent, and can waste a ton of Rich Cats [I speak from experience]. Be prepared to sink some resources here if you're not boosted.
