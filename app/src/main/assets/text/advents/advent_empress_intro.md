# Temptation's Symphony > Aku Melody

## Boss

Possessed Empress Cat has a range and attack cycle similar to Nyandam Variants. While Evil Emperor has access to surge, Empress attacks with mini-waves. She also has a practically unbreakable 1.2M HP shield, with 980K HP and 10 KBs.

## Stage Design

There is an enemy limit of 4 (Effectively 3 due to the enemy base). Doge Dark, Aku Doge, Aku Gory, and Heavenly Hippoe spawn on a regular basis. Shadow Boxer K appear as minibosses. Empress spawns 10 seconds into the stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Aku Researcher** - This stage is basically impossible without a Shield Breaker.
-   **Can Can / Pizza / Slime** - Generalists to kill peons quickly.
-   **Bullet Train** - Can be used to snipe peons now and then.
-   **Octopus** - Blocks mini-waves which saves your Researchers.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Ramen / Manic Eraser** - Meatshields that aren't affected if + Levels are sealed.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Effective at taking out peon waves.
-   **Stone** - Can stop enemies from pushing after Empress attacks. Especially useful against SBKs.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Melee / Rushers:** Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle, Gravolodon.
-   **Shield Breakers:** Divine Kai, Lilin, Hevijak.

Researcher is _usable_ for shield breaks. Other Shield Breakers like Ubers or Li'l Jamiera would be preferable. The levels that matter most are Octo tanking an Empress hit when hypermaxed and Bahamut surviving a hit when at Lv 40 with a Defense combo, if you bring it.

Try not to let the enemies hit your base like Blu ended up doing. Save your cash to deal with the SBKs and starting enemies, from then on it is just Aku Doges and Aku Gories, which should be pretty harmless as long as you don't fuck up. Li'l Eraser + Camera combo ended up not doing much in this lineup, so you could switch in some other useful unit like Bahamut to speed up the stage.
