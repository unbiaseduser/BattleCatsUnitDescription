# River Acheron > Wrath of Carnage

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Rarities: Normal, Special, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: Rare, Super Rare. This makes the stage considerably tougher, since a lot of the units you rely on are Rares and Super Rares [iCat, Roe, Elemental Duelist, Crazed Whale]. There are two distinct ways of beating this stage. One is having decently levelled Normals, and the other is Ubercarry. Most people stick with the latter.

## Must-Have Units [Uberless, no EX Talents]

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - For rushing down R. Osts.
-   **Boosted Island** - Anti-Red tank / DPS. Stops the Bore from shredding your frontline since you don't have access to Manic Eraser. Also good for chipping Hannya, even through weaken.
-   **Boosted Eraser** - Meatshield.
-   **Boosted Li'l Island** - Same purpose as Island, but needs slightly higher levels as it has less base stats.

## Talented EX Alternatives

-   **Dark Lazer** - Attack and Defense are must-have, Wave talent is almost necessary, but Weaken Immunity works too.
-   **Ultimate Bondage** - Only needs Defense up talent. Can substitute Islands after this.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Reds:** Eva 02, Pai Pai, Cat Machine, Mer-Queen Ruri.
-   **Melee Tankers / Rushers:** Divine Kai, Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura.
-   **Epicfests / General rushers:** D'arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Divine Kalisa

## Lineups and Strategies

Note: All the approaches to this stage are a bit high-investment. The talents which you use here [Bondage HP/ DL Talents] are expensive, and farming Islands to +30 or such won't give you massive return for the energy investment either [by 2021 progression standards]. Ubercarry relies on having one of a particular set of ubers, so it isn't super accessible. No matter which approach you choose, expect to go out of your way while making a lineup for this stage.

**Boosted Dual Islands Strat**

The Strong Up Sm + M / Defense Up Sm combo allow both Islands to take a hit from Hannya without flinching. This is great for maintaining a stable frontline.

Send Islands only in the startoff to kill off the Bore. Try and keep Hannya away from your base. Lure R. Ost and Bahamut chain it. If you wish to chain on your base clear off Ginger Snache first. If you can't kill it in a single chain then chip with Dragons or other ranged units. Stall between Bore and R. Ost waves with Islands. Use erasers for R. Ost. Try and Bahamut chain it if you can. Rinse and repeat till Hannya dies. Curseblast can be good to bring here too, but Breakerblast / Thunderbolt work just as well.

**Talented Dark Lazer Strat**

Research and Strong combos are similar in effect. If you have the Seasons of Love combo I'd definitely recommend that. Dark Lazer has Attack, Defense, and Wave talents. Nothing else is talented. Add talented Bondage if you can afford it. Riceball is only for occasionally baiting Hannya hits, I wouldn't recommend it for meatshielding if untalented. Curseblast is used to let Dark Lazer temporarily hit Hannya unweakened.

The video description goes in-depth on the approach, but I'll summarise it here. Start off by spamming Lasers till the first Bore dies. Wait out the first R. Ost and a Ginger Snache wave that comes just after it. Then lure R. Ost to your base and Bahamut chain it [see exact procedure in the video]. Use what you must for the second Bore [I use Ninja as a filler meatshield but it isn't needed if you've brought Island]. The second R. Ost can be Bahamut chained similar to the first, but now Hannya is close to your base so it's a bit more complicated.
