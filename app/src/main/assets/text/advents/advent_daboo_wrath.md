# Dead by Encore > Prisoner's Progress

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Costs: >= 1200. Disallowed Costs: < 1200. Since the regular strat relies heavily on Ramen and Shigong, this makes a massive change to your approach. Rather than relying on meatshields to hold the front line, you'll need Titans or Ubers.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Zombies:** One-Hit Wonders, Subterra Sentinels, BCS Tigerclaw.
-   **Tankers:** Divine Kai, Almighty Hades, Mighty Aegis Garu, etc..
-   **Rushers / Melee:** Immortal Yukimura, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

>Due to the nature of this stage, Ubercarry is heavily recommended. Most non-ubercarry strats are impractical. If you're interested in beating it uberless for whatever reason, boosted Jamieras and Islands are the way to go. If you don't have those, Dark Lazer gets the job done as well.

**Talented Dark Lazer Strat**

Talented Dark Lazer is mandatory, although you won't be spamming her all the time as you might be used to. Rich Cat is needed to sustain her because this stage is stupidly cash tight. Sniper is also needed to get Daboo off of your base, and helps to delay his attacks in general. Pizza works because it's pizza, and Roe is basically the only meatshield / wall that you have.

Try and play conservative. Dark Lazer can drain your money super quickly if you aren't careful. Save up your money for Bahamut during the Angel waves, and your Holy Blast for the Zombie waves [first Zory doesn't count]. As long as you're above 10k cash when no peons are around, you should be fine. When they do spawn, send pretty much everything that you have. Balancing between saving ground and saving money is the key to this stage.
