# Dead on Debut > Parade of the Dead

## Boss

Daboo of the Dead is an omnistrike pusher boss, with a standing range of 300 and a maximum range of 800. He has an enormous 3 million HP with just three knockbacks. On top of that, he has immunity to most status effects, making him a big slowly pushing wall. He deals 30000 damage every 13s, which can one-shot meatshields and a lot of other units. Worst of all, he inflicts a crippling 10s long Slow to anything he hits, making it more difficult to get to him.

## Stage Design

Daboo spawns almost immediately on a timer, followed by a Zroco. Enemies cycle involving Angelic and Zombie peons, including Heavenly Hippoe, Angelic Gory, Zory, and Zir Zeal. After 2-3 waves of both traits the peons die down, giving you a clear shot on Daboo.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is very important to rush down the Angel peons, otherwise they can be a massive nuisance to kill.
-   **Shigong** - Survives two Daboo hits, is Slow immune. Great for dealing with Zombie peons as well.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Can Can** - Solid DPS, good bulk, double bounty with talents helps too.
-   **Ramen** - Solid at stalling Angels, allowing your other units to kill them.
-   **Courier** - Moves fast and deals decent damage to enemies. 

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Zombies:** Subterra Sentinels, BCS Tigerclaw.
-   **Tankers:** Divine Kai, Almighty Hades, Mighty Aegis Garu, etc..
-   **One-Hit Wonders:** Exceptionally great here thanks to solid range, great bulk, great DPS, and Slow Immunity on top of it all.
-   **Rushers / Melee:** Immortal Yukimura, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

BioBone makes Ramen and Shigong considerably better at their job, and also helps other units. Having Sniper goes a long way. The lineup looks a bit different in the video but it is effectively the same as what you see here.

Sniper can be kept on for the entire duration of the run. Send off a Manic Mohawk to bait a Daboo hit. Send meatshields and attackers at a gradual rate to build up money. When the Heavenly Hippoes arrive, send Can Can and pretty much whatever else you have. Awakened Bahamut can be kept reserved for Heavenly Hippoe waves. Use Holy Blast to interrupt Daboo attacks if you have it, otherwise regular cannon works too. Try and keep a decent amount of money in your wallet, and fight out the peon waves. A few minutes later the peons will die down and you should have an easy win.
