# Courts of Torment > The Pure Land

## Boss

Black Okame is a Red / Black variant of Hannya. And before you even try it, she is Freeze Immune. She has 320 Standing Range with omnistrike up till 800. With 24000 damage and a 2.1s attack frequency, she can disable most units that aren't tankers. Even slow bulky units like Island or Pizza struggle because of the knockback. Finally, she has 2.6M HP with just a single knockback, which means you aren't killing her before peons stop cycling [without insane Ubercarry at least].

## Stage Design

Okame spawns almost immediately on a timer, accompanied by a Doge Dark. Doge Dark and Ginger Snache spawn on cycles, along with Gory Blacks. After a couple minutes, the peons die down [there are only 5 Gory Blacks] and you have a free shot on Okame.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Roe** - Pretty much your only way of maintaining a stable frontline.
-   **Manic Island** - Great for both chipping Okame, and giving you some buffer time till your Pizzas arrive to kill Gory Blacks. Also kills Ginger Snache on the side, and help in stalling.
-   **Pizza** - Kills black peons effectively, although he gets stunlocked by Okame if no peons are around.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Cutter** - Can dispose of Ginger Snache immediately, and decent for chipping Okame as well.
-   **Assassin Bear Cat** - Relatively fast, good chance of hitting Black peons, and deals great damage to them.
-   **Talented Box Cats** - Kill Black peons very easily.
-   **Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent)** - Send when Okame is close to your base to gain some extra Crowd Control. Not much else to explain.
-   **Sniper the Deadeye** - Stands outside of Okame's range, and is great for regaining ground.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

Note: Many ubers that would otherwise be great for these traits can suffer greatly on this stage, due to Okame's stunlock. Watch out for anything with high Foreswing or slow Speed, because it will probably not work.

-   **Anti-Blacks [mainly for peons]:** Immortal Yukimura, Kasa Jizo, Legendary Musashi.
-   **Anti-Black / Red KB:** God Emperor Raiden, Immortal Kenshin, etc. These are great for buying ground.
-   **KB Immune Tanks:** Almighty Hades, Divine Kai. These aren't fantastic here, but can definitely be useful for stalling Okame.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Stall / Push Strat**

[+ Sniper]

This lineup uses two Health Up Sm combos. I've swapped out Wrestling's combo with Cameraman's combo which has the same effect, but is more accessible. You could also try Resist combos if you want. Regular Island is used in this lineup, but I would advise against deploying it [unless yours is +30 or higher, and even in that case it's mediocre due to low speed]. Awakened Bahamut can come in clutch for peons, particularly Gory Black.

Lure the first Doge Dark, and kill it for quick money. The stage is really straightforward afterwards. The peons are too weak for there to be any difficulty. That being said, don't bother with trying to kill Okame quickly; peons will die down before you do it anyway, and you'll end up wasting money. Breakerblast and Sniper are both must-haves, as you heavily rely on them for gaining ground. Sniper the Deadeye is also a decent unit here.
