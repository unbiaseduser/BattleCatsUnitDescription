# A Deeper Dream > Wrath of the Dreamer

## Stage Restriction

Disallowed Rarities: Special, Super Rare. Allowed Rarities: Normal, Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. No longer having access to iCat or Roe forces a different strategy. While the general idea is the same [CC Bore/s, stack LD / Cyborg], it becomes less consistent in execution.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Dread Pirate Catley** - Your only reliable source of crowd control with these restrictions.

## Great-to-Have Units

-   **Thaumaturge** - Occasionally hits and procs weaken, allowing your other units to live a bit longer.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Momotaro / Ice Cat:** A solid upgrade over Catley in terms of crowd control.
-   **Kasa Jizo:** Can OHKB or 2HKB Bakoo, able to consistently handle her after hitting base.
-   **LD Snipers / Good-ranged anti-Blacks:** Meow-sketeer, Adventurer Kanna, Glorious Amaterasu, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

Catley is brought for crowd control. Thaumaturge won't hit much in the startoff but can be useful during the boss fight. Enchantress is not used because her proc sucks lmao. Bring Zamboney if you have it.

Lure the Bore close to base, but not quite hitting. Keep 2-3 Catleys on the field to maintain a stable frontline, then build a stack. If Bore isn't dead but you're close to the enemy base, stop spawning everything and let them die; then start over. Rinse and repeat till the Bore dies, then hit the base. If everything goes right, you'll win. While this strat is quite RNG dependent, it's the best accessible approach we've got.
