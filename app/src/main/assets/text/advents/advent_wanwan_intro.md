# Wanwan's Glory > Dogsville

## Boss

Everlord Wanwan has omni and multihit, with the same build as Lord Wahwah. The difference being, his third hit carries a one-minute long warp instead of knockback; and does only 1500 damage.

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with Wanwan immediately, followed by some Relic Doge. Around a minute in, one Capy spawns. Another Capy spawns some while later. Peons include Relic Doge, Sir Rels, Croconators, and Mistress Celeboodles. This stage has a cat limit of only 10, which is challenging because of Wanwan's warp. It limits your meatshielding ability, and makes the enemies push more. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for this stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Great for damaging Capy IF you're not using any other uber for the same job.
-   **Slime** - Can knock back Wanwan from a distance. Great at getting him off your base, especially when fighting Capies. Also chips hordes of peons much better than other options [if timed well].
-   **Can Can** - One-shots Sir Rels at level 41, and deals solid damage to Relic Doge. Tanks a lot of damage and repositions frequently. On top of that, he has warp immunity, making him phenomenally useful here.
-   **Manic Lion** - Fast attack rate is great for killing Croconators. Preferred over crit units because of his short cooldown, and ability to act as a secondary meatshield.
-   **Bullet Train** - Great for getting peons off your base if they're putting pressure [especially Sir Rel].

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Cutter** - Does big damage to Capy if it can land a strengthened hit. Even one strengthened hit can make your life much easier, especially for the second Capy. You can also use it for combo kills on Sir Rels with BTrain / Slime, but this is not recommended outside of emergencies.
-   **Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent, preferably Max Survivor)** - Can slow Wanwan for a distance, which can stall him for long if followed up with a knockback from Slime [or from Cyberpunk's own damage]. You can also use him to slow down Capy and fight a bit far from the base. Whichever way you choose to use him, he's a great pick for this stage.
-   **Catellite** - Warp Immune meatshield that helps to keep cat limit empty. Can also clear Those Guys, which helps your other units [Can Can / BTrain] miss less often.
-   **Stone** - Warp Immunity with tremendous HP and suicide allows Stone to stall very effectively here.
-   **Courier** - Courier is great for chipping Capy due to his LD reach and high DPS output. 

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Reds with Solid DPS:** Pai-Pai DX, Headmistress Jeanne, [Eva-02](https://youtu.be/S2pvcw2tJ04)
-   **Warp-Immunes:** [Bazibastra](https://youtu.be/RbLdglhV6Vc), Li'l Valkyrie, Dark Kasli, Meowsketeer / [Valiant D'arktanyan](https://youtu.be/2rf8LB_HzVY), etc.
-   **Great Generalist Rushers / Melee:** Yukimura, Balrog
-   **Chun-Li:** Can potentially pin Wanwan to the base with a [proper setup](https://youtu.be/Z-mWMQ1I6jA).

## Lineups and Strategies

Note: There are cheese strats for this stage using either Healer or Seafarer. You should avoid these, because the setups are too elaborate and RNG reliant / need immensely difficult timing.

Just a heads up, this guide uses Jiangshi, both with and without talents, in different lineups. If your Jiangshi isn't talented using Catellite is just as good. Jiangshi is a decent pick because high speed, and because he saves Cat Limit thanks to survivor. The stage isn't too cash-intensive either. Pizza and Can Can are there for general DPS, and the rest of the lineup is obvious. There's another lineup with NEO Cutter in this video, refer to that if you have the unit.

This does have some timings to master. Immediately send Bullet Train, don't even upgrade worker. After BTrain hits base you can upgrade worker to 2 [but not 3]. As soon as Wanwan spawns, send Manic Eraser and Can Can, in that order. When BTrain recharges, deploy MEraser. as soon as MEraser recharges, send BTrain again [this is just for timing, so that BTrain hits Wanwan after his first multi-hit]. Ideally it will hit Wanwan and get warped, but if it doesn't hit him that's okay too.

After this point, lure the enemies. Handle the peons as you want, just make sure you don't push too far from your base. When the Capy comes, use Bahamut to damage him, and send the other damagers that you've brought. If all goes well, both the warped bullet trains will arrive and interrupt Wanwan, buying you time to rush Capy. This is a very chaotic stage, so you might not get immediate results even with the correct approach.

In between Capies, you should try to gain ground. Push back Wanwan with well-timed slimes, Can Can, Bullet Train, and Manic Lion. You can send Cyberpunk here, or when the second Capy comes. When the second Capy comes to the field, send everything that you got. It's tough, but once that's done the stage is over. Remember to prioritise getting as many Slime hits as possible. They knock back Wanwan, deal good damage to all peons, and buy you time for other units to attack.

More important than WHAT to do in Wanwan, is WHAT NOT to do. There are many pitfalls in this stage, and even expert players will fall for them from time to time. Without go into too much detail, remember these few points.

-   Do NOT send Slime unless Wanwan has just finished attacking, it will just die.
-   Do NOT spam all meatshields rapidly. You will clog up the Cat Limit.
-   Do NOT panic. Everyone makes mistakes, and with Slime it isn't too tough to recover from them.
-   Do NOT be impatient. If you spam everything, there's a good chance some of your units will get warped.
-   Do NOT let the Sir Rels live. Prioritise killing them as quickly as possible, through whatver damage combo you can get. Reserve Bullet Train / Green Shell for them if you need to. They will tear through your meatshields if you're not careful.

Uses Manic Island for killing peons, a perfectly acceptable alternative to Pizza. Both of them have a tendency to get warped, but Manic Island's fast attack rate and solid DPS make him a great pick for this stage. It uses only a single Bullet Train warp, which is a bit easier to time. Other than that, the basic principle and strategy is the same as the previous lineup.

**Research Up Strat**

Relies on Elemental Duelist to damage Capies. Research combos help both Slime and Elemental Duelist. Otherwise very similar to the previous two strategies. Can Struggle with Relic Enemies compared to the other two lineups, but faster at rushing Capy.
