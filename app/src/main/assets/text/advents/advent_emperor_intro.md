# Possessed by Evil > Prelude to Ruin

## Boss

Evil Emperor Cat has a range and attack cycle similar to Nyandam Variants. However, he also has a Level 3 Surge [600~900 range] with a debilitating status effect. He inflicts Freeze for 1.5s [reset by surge], and curse for 4s. The damage from the surge isn't that much [6.7k per hit]. He has 520 standing range with omni-strike that goes till 620. He's somewhat fast for a Nyandam variant with 6 speed and very little backswing. He has 1.2M HP and 8 KBs, so he's relatively easy to push back if you have a clean hit.

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with Emperor almost immediately. Sir Seals, Ginger Snache, Sir Rels, and two Capies feature as peons early on. After some time, Oldhorn appears as the final threat. Once he's down, there's no one protecting Nyandam and you have an easy win.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Slime** - Can damage Emperor from a distance. Also great for chipping Sir Seals / Capies while the Oldhorn is at front.
-   **Can Can** - One shots Sir Rels at level 41 or higher, and deals good damage to Ginger Snache too. Overall a great pick because of solid survivability and damage.
-   **Manic Island** - Works for roughly the same reasons that Can Can does. The boosted DPS against Red enemies also helps against Capy / Sir Seal.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Slapsticks** - Very helpful against Oldhorn if your Can Can / Manic Island aren't levelled enough to take it down by themselves.
-   **Courier** - Fantastic unit for taking out Capy. Can be used to rush the stage. 

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Melee / Rushers:** Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle, Gravolodon.
-   **Surge-Immune Attackers:** Lasvoss Reborn, Kasli the Bane.

[No items used, but Rich Cat helps.] BioBone increases the efficacy of Can Can, Manic Island, and Slime. Dual erasers are used here, and you should stick with regular Eraser even if yours isn't very high levelled. Rest of the units were explained earlier. Awakened Bahamut is decent for chipping Capy but you have to time him right. A well-timed cannon cancel can also help your Bahamut survive longer.

Lure the Sir Rel / Ginger Snache to your base, and try to get Double Bounty on them. Afterwards, keep the fight as far from your base as possible. This will give more ground to deal with the Oldhorn later. Try and time your slimes to avoid Emperor's surge. This takes a bit of practice but can be great once you have it working. Can Can / Manic Island should deal with the enemies just fine, especially if they're boosted. Slapsticks don't help much here, so don't send them. Send Awakened Bahamut somewhere around the second Capy to chip it down.

When the Oldhorn spawns, you should have one Capy dead and at least one KB on the second Capy. If your units are boosted / you played really well, you can get even the second Capy down by now. However, this is not a requirement. You should also have Emperor pushed back to the enemy base. From here on out, send pretty much everything, and pay extra attention to timing your Slimes. Your Bahamut might recharge towards the end of this fight, but you might not have enough money to send him. If your units are levelled enough and your timing / luck are decent, the Oldhorn should be down before your base is being hit. If so, congratulations, you've won.

Cool Japan gives an attack boost which helps for rushing. Can Can and Maglev are useful for dealing damage to Sir Rel and Emperor. Courier's immense anti-red DPS helps to rush down Capy. Bahamut's used for rushing purposes, and the rest of the lineup is self-explanatory. Rich Cat / Sniper could be used but aren't needed.

Lure the Sir Rel / Ginger Snache to your base, and try to get Double Bounty on them. After you have some money, start spamming Courier and meatshields. Sir Seal should die quite quickly, giving you a lot of money. After Emperor's first hit, wait a couple seconds, then deploy Bahamut. You may want to use Cat Cannon to cancel Emperor's attack during the rush. If done well, Emperor will be gone before Oldhorn spawns, and you can do cleanup from there.
