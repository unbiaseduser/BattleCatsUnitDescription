# Z-Onel Rises > Last of the Dead

## Boss

Death Angel Z-Onel retains the LD reach and attack cycle of Clionel, but now has the Zombie trait instead. She also revives infinite times at 50% HP, and has 1M base HP.This means that she can be quite troublesome if you can't Z-Kill her.

## Stage Design

Features 2 Z-Onels, paired with Zuche, Zoge, Star Peng, Shibalien Elite, and General Gregory. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for this stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Very helpful for rushing down the first Z-Onel, which makes the stage considerably easier.
-   **Slime** - Disposable attacker who can take out Zuche and Zoge conveniently, and helps for chip on tankier peons as well.
-   **Bullet Train** - For killing Zuche before they fuck up your everything.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **A Well-levelled Holy Blast** - Z-Kill snipe strat uses level 18~20 Holy Blast, Li'l Flying / Chadbear strat uses level ~10. Even higher levels are achievable, and the more levelled your cannon is the easier this stage gets.
-   **Can Can / Chill / Seafarer** - All are good at dealing with the Starred Aliens, but you might not have enough slots for all three.
-   **Li'l Flying / Cadaver Bear** - Allow you to get Z-Kill on Z-Onel if you're not using Holy Blast Snipe strat.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Melee / Mid-range Bruisers / Rushers:** Li'l Valkyrie, Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, etc.
-   **Melee / Mid-range / Disposable Anti-Aliens:** Gravolodon, Bazibastra, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Holy Blast Z-Kill Snipe Strat**

Seafarer and Can Can's Alien CC Talents are both great to have here, but not compulsory. You might want Chill Cost Down if trying richless, especially since it's used on Puffer Planet as well. Boosted Manic Island isn't that common, you could try Li'l Flying / Cadaver Bear or talented Housewife there instead [even Dancer or Ubers can work]. Holy Blast Level 15+ is mandatory for this lineup, 18+ is recommended.

Start off by luring the Zoge. Kill it and a Zuche with Slime. Lure the Star Peng to your base, then stack attackers on it. By the time Z-Onel comes, the Aliens should be dead. Send Bahamut now. From here on out, it's a number guessing game. Wait for a bit after Z-Onel's third KB, then fire Holy Blast. If you did it right, you should get a Z-Kill. From here on out, you can improvise, and the video goes more in-depth on that.

**Regular Z-Kill Strat**

This strat works well even with a level 10-12 Holy Blast, but it needs either Li'l Flying Cat [Level 60+ recommended], or Cadaver Bear Cat.

Startoff is almost identical to the above strategy. After dealing with the Star Peng, use Holy Blast to make way for your Li'l Flying stack to enter Z-Onel's blindspot [It's too slow to enter normally]. Afterwards, you kinda just pray that Flying gets the Z-Kill. A higher level Li'l Flying helps. The rest can be improv'd from there on.
