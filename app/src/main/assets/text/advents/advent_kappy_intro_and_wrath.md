## Boss

Kappy stands at 230 range, and deals a devastating 38k damage with each attack. To make matters worse, he has a Level 1 Surge [150~750 range]. He has a decent foreswing [40f], and it's not too difficult to make him miss. If you do lose your stack though, he's going to push a lot due to his 14 Speed. He's traitless, and takes quite a long time to kill [2M HP, 6 KBs].

## Stage Design

The stage features Kappy, paired with a few Scissoroos and Thrillerz. The startoff has a lone Scissoroo with some Thrillerz. On base hit, Kappy spawns with two Scissoroos and some Thrillerz. Scissoroos respawn regularly from now on, and Thrillerz cycle quickly.

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Rarities: Normal, Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: EX, Super Rare. Guides for both the regular and wrath stage are merged, as they both can use the same lineup.

## Must-Have Units

**Stone** - Great for stalling Kappy. Stone-less strategies exist, but I wouldn't recommend them.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Slime / Tourist / Crystal** - Only necessary for stone-less setups.
-   **Pizza** - Cost-effective bonus damage on top of Cameraman.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Surge-Immune Attackers:** Kasli the Bane, Lasvoss Reborn.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Research Stone Strat**

3 x Research up Sm combos sync Stone's respawn cycle exactly with Kappy's attack cycle. This allows you to set up a continuous cycle of making Kappy miss. There are stone-less strats too, but they're less consistent [and typically need level 50 Cameraman or higher]. Cameraman is also great on this stage, as it acts as a ranged meatshield. Scissoroo hitting Cameraman makes Kappy miss, preserving the rest of your stack. For the regular stage, you could try Housewife / Seafarer / Pizza in remaining slots. You can also save up some slots by swapping the research combos with uber equivalents [Sm + M or L research combos have the same effect as 3 x Sm combo]. Crystal can work as well.

Stall Scissoroo in the startoff with meatshields. Once you have money, stack Cameraman. After Scissoroo dies, hit the enemy base. Try and have stone land on Kappy during his backswing. This way, you'll set up a cycle of Kappy missing. Keep spamming Stone and send Cameraman as long as you have money. If done well, you'll have a win from here. Thrillerz and Kappy knockbacks can cause interruptions to your Stone rhythm, so you'll need to reset on those. Overall, less complicated than it sounds on paper.
