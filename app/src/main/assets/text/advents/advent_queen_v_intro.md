# The Old Queen > I'll Be Bug

## Boss

Queen Mother V, has the same range and attack frequency as Queen B, but inflicts Curse instead of Slow.

## Stage Design

Features 2 200% magnification Professor As spawning at a long interval, with waves of peons in between; consisting of Ginger Snache, Relic Doge, and One Horn. Getting hit by curse makes your anti-reds substantially worse against Professor A. So, some seriously good timing is required here.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Manic Island** - Comes in use for chipping Professor A, killing peons, everything. Any level lower than 40 will struggle to survive for long enough, unless you have strong up combos.
-   **Roe** - Your primary tank. You’ll use this to hold back the enemies while your other units keep coming and dying.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - For attacking Professor A, preferably landing multiple hits while doing so.
-   **Bullet Train** - For killing Ginger Snache and Relic Doge, can also be used to chip Professor A if needed. Great as you don’t really need to time it to work.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Cutter** - Does the same damage as an Awakened Bahamut hit to red enemies once strengthened, although it doesn’t always land in a hit. 41s cooldown is half that of Bahamut, which means you get more opportunities when you bring both.
-   **Can Can** - Great for killing One Horn, stalling it with slow, and killing Relic Doge.
-   **Island** - Works as a second M.Island. Especially good if you’re bringing Strong Up Combos.
-   **Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent)** - Good for stalling / slow chipping if you manage to have 2 Prof. A on the field, at which point most of your units won't be able to hit them. Stands outside Relic V range if any other enemies are at front.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Cutter Strat**

BioBone is great on this stage. With Research Up M, Roe’s deployment time becomes exactly twice of Queen Mother V’s attack cycle. This means that once one Roe gets in her blindspot, future Roes will also get in, if you time them the moment they recharge. If you aren’t very good at timing, BioBone is for you. Power Cutter and Li’l Brave Cat have an Attack Up Sm Combo, which is great to have [for a cheap slot count].

Use Cutter and Bullet Train in the startoff as shown to get some cheap damage on Professor A. Lure Queen V close to your base (but not hitting), wait out for a while to build up money, and then send Bahamut. Once you get 2 KBs, the first One Horn should be in front. Beyond this point, the strat is relatively flexible. Try to get knockbacks on Professor A with Power Cutter / Bahamut when you can. Time your units to make sure they’re roughly at the same position as Roe when Queen V attacks. This will make your timings consistent. Once the first Professor A dies, your win is practically guaranteed.

**General BioBone Strat**

[Uses Rich Cat] This strat is like the previous one, with Research Up M and Strong Up Sm. It focuses on landing 2 Bahamut hits just after Prof. As first KB. After that, it stalls till the second Prof. A comes. Rather than using Bahamut to rush down the first Prof. A, it’s kept reserved for the 2x Relic Doge Wave.

**Strong Up Combos Strat**

This strategy stacks Combos (Strong Up Sm + M / Defense Up Sm) to increase the value you get out of Manic Island. Since it lacks BioBone, it requires good timing from the player. You can bring regular Island too if it’s levelled enough. You could try this out if you have the monthly cats needed for the combos. See Yohane’s dual Islands version [here](https://youtu.be/wZ1oZ0O1iJ0).
