# Queen's Condemnation > Royal Jelly Hell

## Stage Design

The stage contains Queen B paired Cyberhorns, Dark Otters, and Wall Doge - with all peons spawning at a relatively slow rate. Arguably easier than the two stages that come before it.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is important to kill Cyberhorn before Queen B gets to your base.
-   **Corrupted Psychocat / Seafarer** - Crowd Control units are important for stalling Cyberhorn. Note that true formed Psychocat makes a significant difference, and Freeze Up Seafarer is great here too. Alternatively, Can Can with Target Alien talent works too. Either of these three will be good, but bringing more is always welcome.
-   **Chill Cat** - For busting down Cyberhorn quickly.
-   **Bombercat** - To stop Dark Otter so your other units can kill it.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Fishman** - For rushing Queen B, preferably before having to fight the second Cyberhorn.
-   **Power Saw** - Same use as Chill, except does slightly better damage for it's cost. Cooldown is high though, so only put it in a filler slot.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Alien / Generalist Rushers:** Meow-sketeer / Valiant D'arktanyan, Li'l Valkyrie / Li'l Valkyrie Dark, Divine Kalisa, etc.
-   **Melee Units with High DPS:** Immortal Yukimura, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**General Rush Strat**

Uses BioBone to get more value out of Chill, among other units. You can also try out Crazed Wall if you have extra slots.

Send one Fishman immediately [this isn't done in the video, but other guides do it and it's a good idea]. This will stall Queen B for a while, and buy you some time to build a stack on cyberhorn later [he'll also kill the first Wall Doge, which makes stacking a bit easier]. Lure Cyberhorn to base, then send everything you have on him. By the time Queen B arrives, Cyberhorn should be dead. Try to Cannon Cancel her attack [this isn't easy, so don't fret if you can't do it]. Try to get a few units into her blindspot, and attempt rush similar to the original stage. Bahamut should also enter her blindspot once his Slow expires, which will help too.
