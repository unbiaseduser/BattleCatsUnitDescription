# Courts of Agony > Heaven and Hell

## Stage Restriction

Unit Limit: This stage has a unit limit of 5. While typically a severe restriction, it's not that much of a problem in this stage, as your units typically don't live that long anyway.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Manic Island** - Anti-Red tank / DPS. Can survive enough Okame hits to stay on the frontline.
-   **Roe** - Same role as Manic Island, although more for stalling than damaging.
-   **Bullet Train** - Capable of dealing quick chip damage to kill off peons.
-   **Assassin Bear** - Pizza is too slow for this stage, so Assassin Bear serves as your source of DPS.
-   **Stone** - Stops enemies from pushing after an Okame attack, if you don't have units on the frontline.

## Great-to-Have Units

-   **Cats in a Box** - Box Cats act as a combination of Bullet Train and Assassin Bear, making them excellent for this stage.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Can deal a lot of damage to an enemy wave if it goes out of control. Works best with Rich Cat.
-   **Power Cutter** - Great for an Attack Up Sm combo, and can also kill a snache quickly.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Disposable Tankers / Rushers:**Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle.

The lineup in the video uses level 50s with no items. If you're using level 40 units, using Rich Cat and Sniper is recommended. BreakerBlast allows you to gain ground quickly. While it may be tempting to bring Cyberpunk or Sniper Deadeye, they don't work here due to the low cat limit.

Your biggest enemy here is the Cat Limit. At no point do you want more than two of any unit. Roe and Manic Island are great for stalling Okame, and Bear should be sent just before black enemy waves. Bullet Train can help to clear out Doge Darks. Bahamut is best saved for Doge Dark + Gory Black waves. Stone should be used sparingly, because it can clog up the Cat Limit.

**Box Cats Strat**

This lineup substitutes Assassin Bear for Talented Box Cats. This makes the stage a lot easier than what it already was. Strong and HP up combos allow Manic Island to live longer and do more damage. Box Cats' weaken and rebound allow them to deal large amounts of damage to Okame.

Use Box Cats to take care of black peons. You could try to add Awakened Bahamut if you wanted. Bullet Train helps for Ginger Snache. If your Breakerblast is underlevelled, make sure there aren't peons in front of Okame when you use it, lest you miss.
