# King Wahwah's Return > Wrath of the Dogelord

## Stage Design

This stage focuses on a peon-spam approach, similar to CotC Broton. Kroxos, Mr. Angels, Ginger Snache, Trolly Bloggers, and Brollows can be seen in the enemy roster.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Slime** - Insanely good for clearing peons, especially if boosted.
-   **Slapsticks / Seafarer / Pizza** - Stackable and affordable AoE DPS with enough bulk to take a beating form Wahwah.
-   **Cyborg** - Fast enough to work [unlike Cameraman], decent range, decent damage, stackable. Cost isn't an issue as the stage has basically infinite money.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Cyberpunk** - Can come in clutch towards the end, by slowing Wahwah while you're fighting Brollows.
-   **Bullet Train** - Excellent for keeping Wahwah pinned to base in startoff and fetching some money. Fails later on due to the peon spam nature of the stage, though.
-   **Green Shell** - Knockback immunity allows it to stall Wahwah for some time.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Kasa Jizo:** Kasa Jizo.
-   **LD / Wave attackers:** Cats in the Cradle, D'artanyan, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Endurance Strat**

Use Bullet Train to pin Wahwah in the startoff and get some cash. When the Mr. Angels come out, start sending your attackers and meatshields. Afterwards, it's more or less a CPU strat. Keep your Cyberpunk saved for when you're pushed to your base. Bring Thunderbolt to enable slime to land hits more consistently, and keep an eye on your money. This is a straightforward stage, although not that easy with low levels.
