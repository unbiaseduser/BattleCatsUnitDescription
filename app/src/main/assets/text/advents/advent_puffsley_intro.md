# Blue Impact > Puffer Planet

## Boss

Puffsley's Comet has a similar build to Brollow, with big damage [40k], full backswing cooldown, and a high KB count [400]. It has 900k HP, with a standing range of 200 and omni-strike till 500. It also has a guaranteed chance to Knockback all units, although this isn't very relevant as there are few cats with above 40k endurance.

## Stage Design

Puffsley's Comet spawns 20 seconds in. It's followed by the first Star Peng. The stage features many more Star Pengs at a rapid respawn rate, along with Three Corporal Weylands and a Project A. After some time the Star Pengs die down, giving you a clean shot at Puffsley. The win-condition of this stage is to outlast the onslaught of Star Pengs. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for this stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Talented Can Can / Seafarer** - Crowd Control and DPS against the Star Pengs.
-   **Chill with Cost Down talent** - DPS against Star Pengs, allows you to kill one before the next arrives.
-   **Catellite** - Warp Immune meatshield which stops Star Pengs from warping your defenses away. Also tanks a Puffsley hit at level 40 or higher.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Saw** - Effectively a combination of Catellite, Green Shell, and Manic Island. Very cost efficient, and great for stalling enemies here.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Aliens:** Bazibastra, Aphrodite, Sharpshooter Saki, etc. Bonus points if they can either tank Puffsley hits or stand far enough to avoid them.
-   **Disposable Rushers / Melee:** Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Endurance Strat**

Aerial Recon is brought for Research Up M, and it also includes Saucers within it which is a Massive Damage Up Sm combo [good for Chill]. Bullet Train can deal extra damage if it gets warped, and the Double Bounty is nice to have. Awakened Bahamut is mostly there for cleanup, but you _could_ send him for Star Pengs as well if you had the money [which, you most likely won't]. BioBone and Uber research combos work as well. Cyberpunk in top row also gives IT Crowd when combined with TTraveller [which is an accounting combo], so it can be brought. Seafarer isn't used here, but it's a decent pick, especially if talented.

Start off with a Bullet Train to keep Puffsley temporarily pushed back. Keep spamming Catellite early on with Can Can. Use Chill sparsely early on to save up some money, and avoid Manic Eraser if you can. Once the Weylands come in, the pressure increases. Play aggressively, spam your units. There isn't much depth to this stage. If you play too conservatively though, the Star Pengs will pile up and demolish your defenses. Once the Pengs die down, you've pretty much won. There's infinite Pengs afterwards at a gradual rate, so save up some money for those. Besides that, use Bahamut / Can Can / BTrain for cleanup, and you'll be good to go. Note that boosting your Can Can / Chill makes this stage much more consistent.
