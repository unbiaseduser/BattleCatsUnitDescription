# Courts of Agony > Okame's Teahouse

## Stage Design

Okame spawns almost immediately, along with a Miz Devil. In the following three minutes, gradually increasing waves of Miz Devils spawn. Once you're done with them, Miz Devils spawn very sparsely one at a time. At this point you've won.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Roe** - Pretty much your only way of maintaining a stable frontline, same as other Okame stages.
-   **Slime** - Slime is consistently capable of hitting all Miz Devils in a wave, and lands hits more consistently than what one might think.
-   **Seafarer / Housewife / Cyborg** - Any of these are good for taking on Miz Devils, but I personally prefer Seafarer because of his bulk and Survivor ability.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Stone** - great for stalling Okame after she attacks. Stops Miz Devils from pushing too much. Green Shell might also work in its absence.
-   **Cyberpunk** - Stalls Okame, can potentially buy you 4-5 seconds to take out a wave.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - You won't get a lot of value of him, but he can take out a Miz Devil wave and helps for chipping later.

Don't. Except Cradle maybe.

## Lineups and Strategies

[+ Sniper]

This lineup uses two Attack Up Sm combos. You could use Brave Cutter instead of Sister Act, or Cool Japan if you have neither. These combos allow slime to take down most of Miz Devil's shield HP, which makes your life a lot easier.

Lure the first Miz Devil, kill it with Slime + Seafarer. Send Roe, and be somewhat judicious with Roe and Stone usage. Keep a watch for your cash, try to level up your wallet. Slime will take care of the first 2-3 peon waves easily, Seafarers should live for quite a bit. Around the fourth wave, you should have enough cash to send Bahamut, which might help [although it's far from compulsory to use him here]. I send Cyberpunk around the fifth wave, and after that it's an easy win.
