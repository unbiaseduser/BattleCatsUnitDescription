# A Deeper Dream > Revenge of the Dreamer

## Stage Design

3 Bakoos spawn on this stage at large intervals. Along with them, we get to see two Elder Sloths, and occasionally a few SBKs.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Seafarer** - Can freeze Elder Sloth, which is obviously a good thing. Also a decent generalist.
-   **Bomber** - Freezes Bakoo, also great for Shadow Boxer Ks
-   **Cameraman** - Great as a ranged meatshield, especially with Survivor talent.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Pizza** - Takes care of dealing damage to Black enemies.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Kasa Jizo:** self explanatory.
-   **Melee Tanker / Rusher Ubers:** Immortal Yukimura, Blanka, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Ranged Meatshielding Strat**

Eraser is only brought for the startoff. Bahamut is used at 36 in the video but 30 is perfectly usable. Pizza Wave, Cameraman Survivor, and Can Can Double Bounty talent are highly recommended. While Seafarer Freeze Up did not exist back then, it's definitely phenomenal here. Legs are optional. Savage Blow on Housewife is good to have too, but far from compulsory. Avoid any short ranged unit unless it has piercing or is Yukimura.

Lure the first Doge Dark to your base, and kill it with Can Can for good money. Send out Seafarer and Bomber to stall for a bit, then clear out the Doge with Pizza. Keep spamming Cameramen and Bombers, save up some money for Bahamut. Once the Gory Blacks are dead, you'll have some respite. The Shadow Boxers are threatening as well, but you should have some money and a good stack by then. Use cannon to interrupt Bakoo's attacks if needed.
