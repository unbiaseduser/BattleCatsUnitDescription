# Clionel Dominant > New Testament

## Stage Restriction

Cat Limit: 5. This makes a massive difference for obvious reasons, mainly that meatshielding is a whole lot tougher now.

## New Must-Have Units

-   **Maglev** - Great for same reasons as the original, but almost necessary here because the stage is tougher.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Disposable Anti-Angels:** Divine Kalisa, Kasa Jizo.
-   **Tanky Anti-Angels:** King Gamereon, Colossal Benkei, etc.
-   **Yukimura:** Yukimura.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Polished Two Cycle Strat**

Attack and Defense combos can be replaced with Resist combos if you don't have the needed units. Base Defense combos are usable here as well. Alternatively, you could try Manic Eraser / Zamboney / Seafarer instead of those. Level 40s are _heavily_ recommended. Can Can and Pizza talents are great to have as well.

Send off a lone MML to kill Bloggers for money. If you've brought Crazed Cow you can use it here as well. When Sleipnir moves in front of Clionel send Maglev. If you're lucky, you'll get 3-4 hits out of Maglev, which will seriously injure Sleipnir. Lure the Angelic Gory, and rush it down with Bahamut. The stage proceeds similar to the original No Plan A afterwards, but the cat limit makes it considerably tighter. Use Seafarer instead of Can Can if yours is missing a lot.
