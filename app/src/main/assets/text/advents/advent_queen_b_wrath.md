# Queen's Condemnation > Honey Drip

## Stage Restriction

Cost <= 3900. The consequence of this is that you cannot use Awakened Bahamut [or normal-price Ubers]

## Must-Have Units

-   **Catellite** - Since the approach here is to outlast the Brollow waves, having Catellite for stalling is a high priority.
-   **Sadako / Octopus** - Serves as a wall that stops Brollows from killing your higher range units. Great unit to bring especially since you're not rushing.
-   **Fishman** - Can one-shot Brollows, and deals good damage to Queen B. Great for chipping almost every enemy on this stage. Thanks to high speed, it can make it into Queen B's blindspot without needing too much timing.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Can Can, preferably with Speed Up** - Damage output is good for cleaning up all kinds of peons, although performance without speed up isn't very remarkable.
-   **Maglev** - Kills a single peon, and gives double bounty. Good to stop Queen B from pushing just after The Sloth attacks, and reduces pressure during Brollow waves.
-   **Vendor** - Can knockback The Sloth, helping you to recover ground.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Ubers with <=3900 Cost and Decent Speed:** Gigavolta, Divine Twinstars, etc.

The Speed combo is optional, and doesn't do a whole lot, so I removed it in the video. Use Vendor instead if you want to, or a 2-Slot Health / Defense / Speed combo. The purpose of most units is the same as the previous stage, except this approach relies very heavily on Catellite and Fishman.

Stall Queen B on the enemy base with Catellite and Fishman, till the first Brollow wave. Lure the Brollows to the base, and send basically everything at them. Once this is done, The Sloth should be behind Queen B; and your units will knock back Queen B. At this point try and get Worker Cat to ~level 6, and play defensively. Catellite spam is great, send Fishman as he recharges. Octopus and Can Can can be sent less frequently. Reserve Maglev to retain your ground when The Sloth attacks / for Brollow waves. After the first two-three waves the Brollows die down, and you can beat down the bosses.
