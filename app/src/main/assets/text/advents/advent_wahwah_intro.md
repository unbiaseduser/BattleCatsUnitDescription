# N-1 Grand Prix > King Wahwah's Revenge

## Boss

King Wahwah stands at 600 range with omni-strike up till 1000. He deals 24000 damage per attack cycle distributed into three equal multi-hits. He has a million HP with 25 KBs, making him relatively easy to knock back [if you can reach him]. All his attacks have guaranteed KB effect. Lastly, he's pretty slow, with just 5 Speed.

## Stage Design

The stage features Wahwah with minimal peons. These include Scissoroo, Zang Roo, Shadow Boxer K, Ottas, and some Doge variants. Not that difficult to handle, but the restriction...

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Rarities: Normal, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: EX, Rare, Super Rare. This leads to a situation where 99% of players will be using heavy Ubercarry for this stage.
