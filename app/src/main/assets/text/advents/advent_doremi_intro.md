# First Errand > Baby Fake

## Boss

Doremi has the same LD range as Bakoo, but is traitless. Additionally, she's considerably faster (14 as opposed to Bakoo's 4), and has higher endurance, much more damage, and a slow instead of freeze proc.

## Stage Design

Startoff consists of an Alpacky with some Mr. Angels for support. After base hit, Doremi spawns with Trolly Bloggers, Mr. Angels, and Director Kurosawah as support.

Bring something that can kill Alpacky. MIsland works but so do 20 other things. Bahamut for reasons that will be clear later. Base Defense combos if you're poor. Attack Up combos also work well here.

Kill Alpacky and stall for max cash. Then hit the enemy base. Use something weak like a meatshield to do so. This will leave a Mr. Angel to rush forward. Lure Doremi to your base, and send Bahamut to hit the Mr.Angel. Before Doremi attacks, use the cannon to stall her and clear out the Trolly Bloggers, with Bahamut now hitting Doremi. This should line up Bahamut to hit both Doremi and the Mr.Angels without either hitting the base. After 20 some repeats, Doremi is dead. GG.
