## Stage Design

Instead of on base hit, Kappy spawns on a timer in this stage. He's accompanied by Loris and Owlbrows, with Relic Doge and Trolly Bloggers for further support.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Stone** - Great for same reasons as the previous stages.
-   **Fishman / Talented Housewife / Medalist** - Good for clearing Owlbrows.
-   **Slapsticks** - Deals with Relic Doge, and has good survivability.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Cyberpunk** - Crowd Control can be useful, and he has good survivability, but you might not have the slots for him.
-   **Idi** - _Incredibly_ situational, but could kill Loris a hell lot faster if you time her right. Doron also works but you probably won't have him here.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Surge-Immune Attackers** Kasli the Bane, Lasvoss Reborn
-   **Certain Anti-traitless / Epicfest Ubers:** D'arktanyan, Kasli the Bane.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Research Stone Strat**

Rich Cat is highly recommended, although not used in the video. Same drill as the previous stage. Timing Stone is a bit easier here, as you're fighting closer to the base and don't have Thrillerz to worry about. Lure close to the base, stack Slapsticks / Housewife, and watch the magic happen. The stage has a tendency to collapse on you if you make any mistakes, so watch out for that. You might need to let your stack die to restart the stone rhythm, and that's okay.
