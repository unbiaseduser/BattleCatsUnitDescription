# Clionel Dominant > A Cat Screaming Love

## Stage Design

This stage contains Clionel paired with highly boosted Heavenly Hippoes. It's almost impossible to push through them without having your stack killed by Clionel, and eventually the enemies push to your base [if you're fighting the stage "normally"]

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Mandatory for rush strat.
-   **Zamboney** - Necessary to stall enemies while Bahamut does his Bahamuting.
-   **Roe** - Serves the same purpose as Zamboney.
-   **Well-levelled Slow Beam** - 3~4 is sufficient, but 8~9 would be recommended. Refer to the strat given below for reasons.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Rushers:** Divine Kalisa, Meow-sketeer, Immortal Yukimura, etc.
-   **Melee Units:** Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Slow Beam / Cannon Rush Strat**

Regular Cannon - [Video](https://youtu.be/GhoYZTmPi0Q) approach from Mickey (recreated by Xan)

For Slow Beam approach, Slow Beam level 8~9 is recommended for this strategy, but 3~4 should be sufficient if your timing is good. Manics with lower levels could work, but Zamboney / Roe are mandatory. Needless to say, Ramen works well in place of Mohawk too.

Stall out the two waves of Relic Doge in the startoff however you want. Lucas uses Cameraman here, I prefer Can Can and Maglev. Stall for a while, then send Roe and Zamboney. Send Bahamut just before Zamboney can hit base, and Maglev with him. Timing is essential here, so pay close attention to the video.

Fire Slow Beam on base hit. Do note that Iron Wall can work as well, but it's not mentioned as no one has a levelled Iron Wall. Maglev should hit the Gabriel in the boss wave, making way for Bahamut and Zamboney to enter Clionel's blindspot. If done right, this should be an easy win from here. Keep spamming meatshields and tanks.

Alternatively, you can try which uses the regular cannon, with a startoff focused on Awakened Bahamut. Stall the first Relic Doge wave, then spawn Awakened Bahamut when you see the next Relic Doge wave spawn. Let Awakened Bahamut trigger the boss wave, in turn letting him get knockbacked by Gabriel. Spawn Maglev when no enemies are in front of Heavenly Hippoe, and then fire your cannon when Hippoe is knocked back. You should not spawn Manic Lion until you fire your cannon.
