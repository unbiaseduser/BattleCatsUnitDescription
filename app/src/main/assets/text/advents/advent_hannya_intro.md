# River Styx > Realm of Carnage

## Boss

Hannya is a red variant of The Face, with an enormous 800 range. She also cripples all units to 25% Attack with her weaken, and has an attack frequency of 5s. She deals 36k damage with one attack, which can one-shot many units, including Awakened Bahamut.

## Stage Design

Hannya spawns almost immediately on a timer, followed by a Bore. About a minute later, R. Ost spawns, and these two enemies keep cycling. Ginger Snache are sent intermittently, with Sir Seals appearing as well later on.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is used against either Hannya or R.Ost, depending upon the strategy. Either way, he's a mandatory unit.
-   **iCat** - Mandatory for the rush strat, great to have for regular approach too. Makes stalling the Bore easy, and can permafreeze Hannya when stacked. Speed is a bit of an issue, but this can be fixed with Speed / Research combos or Speed Up talent.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Can Can** - Solid DPS, good crowd control for Bore.
-   **Roe** - Stalls Bore consistently allowing your other units to proc on it. Can also weaken Hannya, allowing your units to tank a hit from her in case ICat permafreeze fails.
-   **Crazed Whale / Elemental Duelist** - Anti-Red DPS.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Reds:** Eva 02, Pai Pai, Ice Cat.
-   **Certain Weaken-Immunes:** Balrog, to an extent Lasvoss.
-   **Epicfests / General rushers:** D'arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Divine Kalisa

## Lineups and Strategies

Note: An approach involving Bahamut Chaining on R. Ost is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it. Most lineups that can make it work will work better with a conventional Rush.

**General Rush Strat**

BioBone helps to rush down the Bore quickly, and allows you to get more iCats, which means more chance of permafreeze lasting for the full rush. The rest of the lineup should be self-explanatory. The playlist also has lineups with Freeze Up combos, Speed Up combos, and a setup without Sushi. Alternatively, you can try your luck with [iCat Speed Up talent](https://youtu.be/L1HdKqJE5ag).

Lure the first Bore up close, throw everything you got at him except Bahamut. The Bore should die just before Hannya gets up close, and your Sushis will take a hit. After that, you should get a permafreeze from iCat, and you can start Bahamut chaining. If all goes well, Hannya will be dead before the R. Ost arrives. You can use Thunderbolt cannon to stall her if she unfreezes, and the Weaken from Sushi will allow your units to tank a hit from her, if needed.

**Courier Endurance Strat**

This lineup uses BioHazard along with Moby Dick. BioHazard gives a research boost, which is useful for spamming Courier more often, while also giving a boost to Can Can and Crazed Whale. Moby Dick's HP boost can be replaced with another HP Up or Strong Up Combo. Courier handles Ginger Snache, while Crazed Whale's DPS helps for Bore. Can Can provides CC. Hannya is chipped with occasional Courier hits, and Bahamut later on. Sniper is not used in this video, but it can be great at gaining ground. Turn it off whenever you lure R. Ost though.

Rather than luring, this strat involves starting the fight far off from the base. Use most of your attackers except bahamut, but be a bit judicious with Courier usage at the start to keep a decent amount of money. The Bore should be gone before R. Ost spawns. Stall the R. Ost for some time, then lure it to the base. Bahamut chain the R. Ost as shown in the video. If you've timed it right. You could get a couple Bahamut hits on the second Bore as well. You'll need to stall the second R. Ost as well till Bahamut recharges, but after it dies you should have an easy win.
