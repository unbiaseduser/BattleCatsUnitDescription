# Rashomon > Aku Reincarnation

## Boss

Sathankhamun VIII is an Aku variant of Hannya. He wields 650 standing range with omnistrike up till 800. He has 34000 damage per hit and inflicts slow of 2 seconds. His attack frequency is 4.3s. While Sathankhamun is an Aku enemy, he does not have any Aku Shield. That being said, he's still a nasty pusher.

## Stage Design

Sathankhamun spawns immediately, followed by a Nimoy Bore. A minute later, Chik-ful-a spawns. Alongside it, a Puffington appears. It's best to finish the Nimoy Bore before Puffington spawns. Cerberus kids appear as peons. There are more Chik-ful-as and Puffingtons, but their respawn delay is massive [around five minutes]. By then, you should be done with the stage. Note that the stage is quite long, and somewhat cash-tight.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Seafarer / Chill / Can Can** - Essential for rushing down the first Bore.
-   **Cyberpunk / Stone** - These stop the enemies from pushing immediately after a Rashomon attack (which will knock back everything that it hits).
-   **Slime / Bullet Train / Awakened Bahamut** - There are very few units that can deal significant damage given the amount of DPS on the frontline. These three are realistically the only ones who will land hits, although Fishman has also been reported to be usable.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Idi** - Idi can make quick work of Puffington, and makes this stage much easier.
-   **Doron** - Freezing Puffington gives you a clean easy hit on Chick-ful-a.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Angel Damage-Dealers:** Jizo's Mega-Castle, Divine Kalisa.
-   **Anti-Puffington Tech:** Catman, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, Immortal Yukimura, Lasvoss.

This lineup uses Sunbathers combo for some extra money at the start. You can use rich cat if you feel the need. Chill cat, Seafarer, and Can Can are good for chipping the Bore at the start. Slime is great if it hits Cerberus Kids, but it needs good timing to work properly. Cyberpunk is there for general crowd control.

Lure the Bore close to your base, then chip it down with everything you got. Don't use stone till you're fighting Sathankhamun, it'll just waste money. Focus on getting rid of the bore quickly, Seafarer Freeze Up and Chill Cost Down talents will help here, alongside Can Can Target Alien. Once the Bore is down, you should be seeing the remaining boss enemies on the field. Time slime regularly for some chip, use Bullet Train + Stone to keep Puffington pinned behind. Cyberpunk should give you some breathing room, and sending Stone immediately after Sathankhamun attacks will reduce the amount of enemy push some more. Use Bahamut on Chik-ful-a whenever you get an opening, and you should be good to go. After the Chik-ful-a is down, you've pretty much won.

**Idi Strat [Seal Level 50]**

"With a single Defense Up Combo, Lv 50 Fishman and Bullet Train can survive a hit from every single enemy here. The same applies to Idi at Lv 40. With two Defense Up Combos, which is what I used, Lv 40 Bahamut can also survive a hit from every single enemy in the stage, but this didn't really do much to me anyway." Besides combos, Blu uses Bahamut for the first Bore [something not feasible in the previous strat as you need him for Chick-ful-a], and he relies on Fishman for chip damage as well. Cameraman is just for combos here.

Since his Fishman has Speed Up talent, it's capable of chipping more conveniently between enemy attacks. Breakerblast is the preferred cannon here to regain lost space. Idi takes out Puffington almost instantly, and the rest proceeds smoothly. This is a faster strategy catered more towards end-game players due to the unit and level constraints.
