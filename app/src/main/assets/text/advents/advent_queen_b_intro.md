# Queen's Coronation > Honey Trap

## Boss

Queen B stands at 999 range with 888~1332 LD. She inflicts Guaranteed permaslow and has a 3.3s attack frequency, with 12k damage per attack. You need at least 9 speed to enter her blindspot [unless you're luring]. She is Alien / Floating.

## Stage Design

The stage contains Queen B paired with The Sloth. Peons include occasional Brollow waves and Kroxos.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is perfect for this stage. With high speed and solid DPS, he'll be your primary source of damage. A crucial part of all rush strats.
-   **Sadako** - Serves as a wall that stops Brollows from killing your higher range units. Great unit to bring even if you're not rushing.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Butterfly / Fishman** - Can one-shot Brollows, and deals good damage to Queen B. High speed lets her enter Queen B's blindspot easily. Also decent for chipping other enemies.
-   **Can Can, preferably with Speed Up** - Damage output is good for cleaning up all kinds of peons, and contributes in rush strat as well.
-   **Castaway / Seafarer / Necromancer** - Can freeze Queen B, making it easy for other units to enter her blind spot.
-   **Magica / Thaumaturge** - Might weaken The Sloth, allowing your Bahamut to survive a hit from it. With that it's possible to rush Queen B in just one Bahamut chain.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Floating / Anti-Traitless / Generalist Rushers:** Meow-sketeer / Valiant D'arktanyan, Li'l Valkyrie / Li'l Valkyrie Dark, Divine Kalisa, etc.
-   **Certain Slow-Immunes:** High-Lord Babel, Strike Unit R.E.I., Rock Revengers / One-Hit Wonders.
-   **Generalist Tankers:** Divine Kai, Hades the Deathdealer, Cats in the Cradle

## Lineups and Strategies

>Note that it is possible to beat Queen B without rushing, if relying on boosted units / True Forms / Ubercarry; but that is not mentioned here. It can also require timing which may take some practice, and the rush approach is usually considered better.

**General Rush Strat**

Maiden's Defense combo is optional, you can use other appropriate units for the filler slot. This lineup also uses Cameraman for damaging Queen B / Brollows / Kroxos.

Lure Queen B to the base, then start stacking Cameraman / Sadako / Butterfly / Can Can / etc. on her. After the first Knockback, deploy Bahamut. This mostly leads to a consistent chain. Freeze from Necromancer / Necro-Dancer and Castaway / Seafarer makes a clean entry for your other units. Weakening The Sloth with Magica can allow your Bahamut to tank a hit from it, but this isn't absolutely necessary.
