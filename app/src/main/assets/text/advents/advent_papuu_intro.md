# Papuu's Paradise > Saintly Sister

## Boss

Heavenly Herald Papuu [Angel] deals 4000 Damage per hit, with 40% extra toxic damage on top of it. With her tremendous Omni range, she'll be almost always hitting your base. She strengthens to 3x at 30% HP, becoming much more deadly. She also has immunities to every negative effect except Curse and Sniper KB, both of which greatly debilitate her.

## Stage Design

The stage is relatively short, and Papuu spawns nearly immediately; followed by two Sir Rels. Following this, there are a few peon waves with weak Dagshunds and Wall Doges. After three Dagshunds and a few Sir Rels, the peon flow mostly stops, allowing you to get clean hits on Papuu. Overall, a very easy stage with the right lineup and approach.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Can Can** - Big damage, one shots Sir Rels at level 41 or higher. Also great for killing basically every other peon, and survives two Papuu hits.
-   **Bullet Train** - Secondary Sir Rel killer. Works great to kill peons when they're close to your base, or to snipe them while Papuu is attacking.
-   **Manic Island** - Great for killing peons. Survives two Papuu hits, and has enough endurance to tank a Sir Rel hit. Deals great damage too.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Great for damaging Papuu quickly, especially if you're bringing Curseblast.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Riceball** - A little bit more bulk than Manic Eraser, plus Toxic Immune. Great for the stage if you can afford the NP.
-   **Slime** - Not the most accessible unit for this stage, but a great pick. Big wave damage good for killing peons [obviously].
-   **Ramen** - Great bulk for tanking Papuu hits, and good for chipping her when peons aren't around.

[Level 10 Base Defense, Sniper]

[Video](https://youtu.be/tjzpmUtevLM)

Base Defense Combo allows you to survive Papuu hits for longer, especially if your base isn't fully upgraded. If you don't need it then you can try an Attack Up combo instead. Green Shell can be swapped out for Eraser, both are decent here. Ramen is also a staple for this stage, but I chose to not bring it. Curseblast and Bahamut are mandatory for this setup. There's another lineup with no Sniper and Pizza instead of Slime in the video, you can check that out if you want.

Use Manic Eraser to bait out a Papuu hit, and lure Sir Rel close to your base. Wait out the first Dagshund, lure it to base, and kill it with whatever you have. Now that you have a gap, send Bahamut. Use Curseblast to take an extra hit, and utilise Shell / BTrain to protect your Bahamut from Sir Rels. Sniper will also help you do extra damage if you have it. Rinse and Repeat. If you have enough base HP [which you should if you didn't let any enemies hit your base], send the second Bahamut after the last Dagshund, and just after Papuu falls into strengthen range. At this point, it should be an easy win.
