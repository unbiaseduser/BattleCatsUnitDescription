## Boss

Bakoo is a Black enemy with 180 standing range, an LD attack ranging from 50 to 1850, freeze with 177% uptime, a 2.83s attack frequency, and 10000 damage. To compensate, she has a very low 4 Speed, and 500k HP with 10 KBs [putting her at a relatively low endurance of 50k].

## Stage Design

A Bore spawns in the startoff. When you hit the base, Bakoo is deployed; along with a Kang Roo and a Bore. Some Wall Doge follow after, and another Bore spawns after a while.

## Must-Have Units

-   **iCat** - Allows guaranteed and effective crowd control for the Bores. With him you can use them as LD stepping stones to kill Bakoo.
-   **Medalist / Vaulter / Cyborg** - Any decent LD unit works really, but these two are great. You could always try Cyborg as well. These will help you to chip Bakoo [and hopefully KB her before she attacks your stack].

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Momotaro:** Works as a substitute for iCat.
-   **Kasa Jizo:** Works as a substitute for LD Unit / Cyborg.

Most other Ubers are unnecessary here, if not counterproductive.

## Lineups and Strategies

**LD Stack Strat**

BioBone allows you to get 2 iCats in time if your base HP is low. Otherwise very straightforward lineup.

Lure the Bore close to your base. Send iCat and Crazed Tank. Bore will knock back your iCat once it unfreezes, then you can stall it on your base. Wait till the second iCat. Once two iCats are out, you'll have permafreeze. Stall for money if you want, then start stacking Cyborgs. Once the Bore dies, your iCat stack will hit the base. Fire cannon when this happens to cancel Bakoo's attack. After that, just watch the magic.
