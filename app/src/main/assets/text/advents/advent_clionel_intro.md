# Clionel Ascendant > No Plan A

## Boss

Cruel Angel Clionel stands at 600 range, with an LD reach of 400~1200. She deals 32000 Damage in a single hit, and attacks every 4.8s. She has 2.4M HP with just 4 KBs. While her blindspot is large, she's almost always featured with support enemies which fill it up, making her a forbidable foe.

## Stage Design

The stage features the deadly duo of Clionel and Sleipnir. Clionel's blindspot of 400 is almost completely covered by Angelic Sleipnir, leaving no safe zone for any cats. This makes the combo difficult to fight without any specific strategy. Additionally, there are Trolly Bloggers who can push your units into Clionel's range, and Angelic Gories who plow through your defenses.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is a must-have for rushing the Angelic Sleipnir.
-   **Ramen** - Almost mandatory for stalling Angels, especially the Angelic Gory waves.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Maglev** - Snipes Trolly Bloggers for good money, and rebounds on Sleipnir KB, great for chipping it in the startoff.
-   **Manic Macho Legs / Medalist** - Good for cleaning up Trolly Bloggers.
-   **Can Can, preferably with Double Bounty** - Good damage on Angelic Gories.
-   **Seafarer / Pizza** - Also for Angelic Gories. Note that Seafarer's Speed and Survivor ability make him better of the two to bring on this stage.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Disposable Anti-Angels:** Divine Kalisa, Kasa Jizo.
-   **Tanky Anti-Angels:** King Gamereon, Ushiwakamaru, etc.
-   **Yukimura:** Yukimura. Almost no other rushers have viability here.

The video is new, goes well in depth, and is self-explanatory. There is no need for me to summarize it. Levels used in it are converted to True Form equivalents here.
