# River Acheron > Revenge of Carnage

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with a few Znache. When you hit base, Hannya spawns; starting a few waves of Zombie peons. These include Zroco, Zigge, and Zir Zeal. After a couple minutes the peons die down, and you're free to take out Hannya.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Housewife** - Good range. Slow is helpful against the peons. Can get Z-Kills occasionally [much more potent with Savage Blow talent]
-   **Pizza** - Great mid-range DPS and cash-efficient as well. Especially great if you have his Wave Attack talent.
-   **Maglev and Roe** - Only really there for the cleanup, which can be painfully slow without them.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Shigong** - To stall Zombie peons.
-   **Cyberpunk** - Provides CC from a distance.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Z-Killers with good CD:** Li'l Valkyrie, Mighty Aethur, Sarukani, etc.
-   **Low CD Melee Ubers / Rushers:** Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, Immortal Yukimura, Meow-sketeer, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

Research Combo helps mainly for Shigong. Other units are explained above. Holy Blast helps a lot but it isn't necessary by any means, as the stage is relatively easy.

Send a single Pizza in the startoff to build up money. There's fancier setups for the startoff but this is very straightforward and gets the job done. You should have about worker Level 6 and 5k money in your wallet when hitting base. Afterwards the only real concern is money. Don't send Bahamut outside of an emergency and try to get Housewife Z-Kills [by not sending more of Pizza / Can Can than needed]. This helps to conserve money too. If the third or fourth Zir Zeal end up close to your base you can rush them down with Bahamut as well. Afterwards just pin Hannya with Roe and kill Zrocos with Maglev / Housewife.
