# Introduction

CatCombos become available after beating EoC chapter 1, and more are unlocked as you complete further chapters. CatCombos only work on the top row of battle lineups and can occupy up to 5 unit slots. There are many different types of CatCombos and levels, ranging from Small (Sm) to Extra Large (XL). This guide covers all cat combo types and how cat combo levels affect a unit's stats/abilities.

# How to Read This Guide

Combos are shown in a table, with the first column being the combo level (Sm/M/L/XL) and the second column showing the potency of the effect it causes.

|X|Effect at level X|
|:---:|:---:|

Not all combo levels that exist in theory currently have combos in the game which use them.

Each type of combo will be accompanied by an example showing how they affect something, to be clear about what the number in the table means.

>### E.g.
>A Level Z combo will increase [something] from AAA to BBB.

Those examples may include additional information about how the Cat Combo works, or its limitations:

>With full treasures, the Damage multiplier for a trait can be increased to 4.  
In this instance, the Massive Damage Sm combo increases the multiplier to 4.4.<br>
This does not affect the Insane Damage ability, only Massive Damage.

See also the [Other Information](#otherinformation) section at the end of this guide for miscellaneous information about combos in general.

# Unit Abilities

## Strong Against

|Sm|+10% Attack Multiplier (×1.1) /<br>-10% Damage Taken (×0.9)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Attack Multiplier (×1.2) /<br>-20% Damage Taken (×0.8)|
|L|+30% Attack Multiplier (×1.3) /<br>-30% Damage Taken (×0.7)|
|XL|+50% Attack Multiplier (×1.5) /<br>-50% Damage Taken (×0.5)|

>### E.g.
>Baby Gao at Level 46 does 10,000 Damage normally.  
Strong multiplies this by 1.5 for 15,000 Damage vs Traited.  
With Strong UP Sm, this multiplier increases by 10% to 1.65.  
Baby Gao will then do 16,500 Damage with the combo.<br>  
Zroco at 200% magnification does 10,000 Damage.  
Baby Gao has the Strong ability, so takes 0.5 times this (5,000) from Traited.  
With Strong UP Sm, this multiplier decreases by 10% to 0.45.  
Baby Gao therefore takes 4.500 damage from Zroco with the combo active.

>With full treasures, the default Attack Multiplier can be increased to 1.8 and the default Damage Taken multiplier to 0.4.  
In this instance, the Strong UP Sm combo increases the multipliers to 1.98 and 0.36, respectively.

## Massive Damage

|Sm|+10% Massive Damage Multiplier (×1.1)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Massive Damage Multiplier (×1.2)|
|L|+30% Massive Damage Multiplier (×1.3)|
|XL|+50% Massive Damage Multiplier (×1.5)|

>### E.g.
>Kasa Jizo at Level 46 does 10,000 Damage normally.  
Massive Damage multiplies this by 3 for 30,000 Damage vs Black/Angel.  
With Massive Damage UP Sm, this multiplier increases by 10% to 3.3.  
Kasa Jizo will then do 33,000 Damage with the combo.

>With full treasures, the default Massive Damage multiplier for a trait can be increased to 4.  
In this instance, the Massive Damage UP Sm combo would increase the multiplier to 4.4.<br>
  _This does **not** affect the Insane Damage ability, only Massive Damage._

## Resistant

|Sm|-10% Resistant Multiplier (×0.9)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|-20% Resistant Multiplier (×0.8)|
|L|-30% Resistant Multiplier (×0.7)|
|XL|-50% Resistant Multiplier (×0.5)|

>### E.g.
>Zroco at 200% magnification does 10,000 Damage.  
Sifu Cat has the Resistant to Zombie ability, so takes 0.25 times this (2,500).  
With Resistant UP L, this multiplier is reduced by 30% to 0.175.  
Sifu therefore takes 1,750 damage with the combo active.

>With full treasures, the default Resistant multiplier for a trait can be reduced to 0.2.  
In this instance, the Resistant UP L combo decreases the multiplier to 0.14.<br>
  _This does **not** affect the Insanely Tough ability, only Resistant._

## Knockback

|Sm|+10% Knockback Distance (×1.1)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Knockback Distance (×1.2)|
|L|+30% Knockback Distance (×1.3)|
|XL|+50% Knockback Distance (×1.5)|

>### E.g.
>Pirate Cat knocks back Red enemies by 165 range.  
With Knockback UP M, this increases by 20% to 198 range.

## Slow

|Sm|+10% Slow Duration (×1.1)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Slow Duration (×1.2)|
|L|+30% Slow Duration (×1.3)|
|XL|+50% Slow Duration (×1.5)|

>### E.g.
>Can Can Cat slows Red enemies for 120f (4s).  
With Slow UP M, this increases by 20% to 144f (4.8s).

## Freeze

|Sm|+10% Freeze Duration (×1.1)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Freeze Duration (×1.2)|
|L|+30% Freeze Duration (×1.3)|
|XL|+50% Freeze Duration (×1.5)|

>### E.g.
>iCat freezes Red enemies for 60f (2s).  
With Freeze UP M, this increases by 20% to 72f (2.4s).

## Weaken

|Sm|+10% Weaken Duration (×1.1)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Weaken Duration (×1.2)|

|Sm|+20% Strengthen Multiplier (absolute)|
|:---:|:---:|

|XL|+100% Strengthen Multiplier (absolute)|

>### E.g.
>Balrog at Level 12 does 30,000 Damage normally.  
With max Strengthen talent, he gains +200% damage at 33% HP, bringing the total damage to 90,000.<br>
  With Strengthen UP M, this is increased by 30% to +230% (99,000 total Damage).  
He still does 30,000 damage (unboosted) when not Strengthened.

>Note that this results in the same damage as just equipping an Attack Power UP Sm combo, but does not affect the unstrengthened Balrog or other cats while the Attack Power combo would.

  

>### E.g.
>Immortal Keiji at Level 16 does 13,000 Damage normally.  
With max Strengthen talent, he gains +150% damage at 50% HP, bringing the total damage to 32,500.<br>
With Strengthen UP M, this is increased by 30% to +180% (36,400 total Damage).  
He still does 13,000 damage (unboosted) when not Strengthened.

>Note that this is _better_ than a Sm Attack Power when strengthened, though still has the drawback of not working while unstrengthened and / or on other cats.

## Critical

|Sm|+1% to chance of critical hit (absolute)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+2% to chance of critical hit (absolute)|

|M|Recharge 30% faster|
|L|Recharge 40% faster|
|XL|Recharge 50% faster|

|L|Initial Wallet lv +3|
|XL|Initial Wallet lv +4|

>### E.g.
>When you start a battle, your Wallet is usually at Level 1.  
With Starting Level UP M, instead, it will start at Level 3.

>The effect of this combo does not stack with the Rich Cat powerup, which makes you start at Max Level regardless.

## Wallet Capacity

_This combo is called "Worker Cat Max UP" in-game._

|Sm|+10% capacity (×1.1)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% capacity (×1.2)|
|L|+30% capacity (×1.3)|

# Battle Result

## Research Power

|Sm|+10% Research Power<br>(usually 26f or 0.87s)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Research Power<br>(usually 52f or 1.73s)|
|L|+30% Research Power<br>(usually 79f or 2.63s)|
|XL|+50% Research Power<br>(usually 132f or 4.40s)|

>### E.g.
>Pizza Cat normally has a cooldown of 576f (19.20s).  
With Research Power UP L, this is decreased by 79f to 497f (16.57s).

>There is a minimum cat cooldown of 60f (2s), and combos will not lower it beyond this point.<br>
  When using multiple combos, percentages are added together _before_ their multiplication. This means research Sm + M is always equivalent to research L.<br>
  Without treasures or upgrades, Research Power combos have no effect because research power starts at 0. Each treasure set adds 30f and each research upgrade past level 1 adds 6f to research power.<br>
With full research upgrades and treasures, research power naturally reduces cooldown by 264f (8.80s).

## Accounting

|Sm|+10% Money Drop|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+20% Money Drop|
|L|+30% Money Drop|
|XL|+50% Money Drop|

>### E.g.
>One Horn drops 9,875 money when killed.  
With Accounting Power UP Sm, this is increased by 10% to 10,863.  

>This <u>does</u> stack with the Double Money ability.

## Study Power

|Sm|+10% XP|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+15% XP|
|L|+20% XP|
|XL|+30% XP|

>### E.g.
>XP Colosseum with the Cat Jobs item (+50% XP) gives 874,200 XP.  
With Study Power UP Sm, this is increased by 10% to 961,620 XP.

>The effect of Study <u>does</u> stack with the Cat Jobs item.<br>  
This Cat Combo, just like the Cat Jobs item, will not affect set drops of XP, such as XP gained from timed score rewards.

# Other (Collab)

## Eva Angel Killer

|Sm|+400% Eva Angel Killer<br>Multiplier (×5)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+400% Eva Angel Killer<br>Multiplier (×5)|
|L|+400% Eva Angel Killer<br>Multiplier (×5)|
|XL|+400% Eva Angel Killer<br>Multiplier (×5)|

>### E.g.
>Eva Unit-00 at Level 30 has 127,500 HP and does 46,750 Damage.  
Eva Angel Killer multiplies this by 5 for 637,500 HP and 233,750 Damage vs Eva Angels.<br>
With Eva Angel Killer UP XL, this multiplier increases by 400% to 25.  
Eva Unit-00 will then have 3,187,500 HP against and deal 1,168,750 Damage to Eva Angels with this combo.

>The Eva Angel Killer ability only works against the Collaboration Eva Angels such as Ramiel, and will do nothing against normal angels or any other enemies.  

## Witch Killer

|Sm|+400% Witch Killer<br>Multiplier (×5)|
|:---:|:---:|
|M|+400% Witch Killer<br>Multiplier (×5)|
|L|+400% Witch Killer<br>Multiplier (×5)|

Witch Killer multiplies this by 5 for 51,000 HP and 13,600 Damage vs Witches.<br>
With Witch Killer UP XL, this multiplier increases by 400% to 25.  
Li’l Devil Homura will then have 255,000 HP against and do 68,000 Damage to Witches with this combo.

>The Witch Killer ability only works against the Collaboration Witches such as Kirsten, and will do nothing against other enemy types.  

# Other Information

The form of the cat in the combo can be higher than the one specified, but not lower. For example, the "Midsummer Sun" combo takes Cooldown Cat and Solar Cat. You could use their true forms, Bombercat and Chill Cat, but using their first forms (Flower Cat and Wheel Cat, respectively) would have no effect.

No CatCombos have more than one Gacha unit (Rare Capsule unit) in them. This rule was implemented in version 4.8. There used to be more than 20 CatCombos that contained multiple Gacha units, including ones that contained multiple ubers (For example, “Thunder and Lightning”, which consisted of Thundia and Windy). All combos that contained multiple Gacha units were removed.

Combos of the same type stack additively. That is, if you have two combos that add +10% to a stat, say Attack, it adds +20% (not `×1.1×1.1 = +21%`).
