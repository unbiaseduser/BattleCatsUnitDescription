# Step 1: Finding your inquiry code

Your inquiry code is absolutely necessary for PONOS to retrieve your save data. If you haven’t yet, write this down or screenshot it to make sure you can find it in case your save goes missing. The inquiry code is located in the top left of the main menu screen.

# Step 2: Emailing PONOS

The next step is to request PONOS to recover your save. You will need to send an email to [support_en@bc01.ponos.net](mailto:support_en@bc01.ponos.net) for the English version of the game. In this email, you should aboutList your inquiry code, the time since you last logged in, and your estimated user rank and catfood amount. This will give PONOS support all the information they should need to recover your save. Once the email is sent, you should get a response within 1-4 business days. If you didn’t provide enough information, the support member may ask you to aboutList your user rank and catfood amount. To avoid having to wait longer for a second response, it is recommended that you include all of the information possible in your first email.

# Step 3: Entering your transfer codes

Once PONOS recovers your save data, they will send you an email that looks like this.

Note the "Transfer Code" and "Confirmation Code" at the bottom. These codes are how you will return your save data to your Battle Cats app. Here is [a video](https://youtu.be/rGwj6KFrCTU) showing how codes can be entered into the Battle Cats app.  
_Note: The video uses a fresh account as an example._

Step-by-step guide:

1.  From the main menu, select Settings > Data Transfer
2.  Select "Resume Data Transfer"
3.  Type in your transfer and confirmation codes
4.  Select "Resume Transfer"
5.  Select "Return to Title Screen"
6.  The game will now load normally.

**Note that because PONOS does not automatically back up game data, your progress may be slightly behind where you left off.** However, this usually will only set you back a day or two at most. In many cases, your game progress will not be affected at all.
