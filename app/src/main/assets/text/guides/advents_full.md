# Queen's Coronation > Honey Trap

## Boss

Queen B stands at 999 range with 888~1332 LD. She inflicts Guaranteed permaslow and has a 3.3s attack frequency, with 12k damage per attack. You need at least 9 speed to enter her blindspot [unless you're luring]. She is Alien / Floating.

## Stage Design

The stage contains Queen B paired with The Sloth. Peons include occasional Brollow waves and Kroxos.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is perfect for this stage. With high speed and solid DPS, he'll be your primary source of damage. A crucial part of all rush strats.
-   **Sadako** - Serves as a wall that stops Brollows from killing your higher range units. Great unit to bring even if you're not rushing.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Butterfly / Fishman** - Can one-shot Brollows, and deals good damage to Queen B. High speed lets her enter Queen B's blindspot easily. Also decent for chipping other enemies.
-   **Can Can, preferably with Speed Up** - Damage output is good for cleaning up all kinds of peons, and contributes in rush strat as well.
-   **Castaway / Seafarer / Necromancer** - Can freeze Queen B, making it easy for other units to enter her blind spot.
-   **Magica / Thaumaturge** - Might weaken The Sloth, allowing your Bahamut to survive a hit from it. With that it's possible to rush Queen B in just one Bahamut chain.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Floating / Anti-Traitless / Generalist Rushers:** Meow-sketeer / Valiant D'arktanyan, Li'l Valkyrie / Li'l Valkyrie Dark, Divine Kalisa, etc.
-   **Certain Slow-Immunes:** High-Lord Babel, Strike Unit R.E.I., Rock Revengers / One-Hit Wonders.
-   **Generalist Tankers:** Divine Kai, Hades the Deathdealer, Cats in the Cradle

## Lineups and Strategies

>Note that it is possible to beat Queen B without rushing, if relying on boosted units / True Forms / Ubercarry; but that is not mentioned here. It can also require timing which may take some practice, and the rush approach is usually considered better.

Maiden's Defense combo is optional, you can use other appropriate units for the filler slot. This lineup also uses Cameraman for damaging Queen B / Brollows / Kroxos.

Lure Queen B to the base, then start stacking Cameraman / Sadako / Butterfly / Can Can / etc. on her. After the first Knockback, deploy Bahamut. This mostly leads to a consistent chain. Freeze from Necromancer / Necro-Dancer and Castaway / Seafarer makes a clean entry for your other units. Weakening The Sloth with Magica can allow your Bahamut to tank a hit from it, but this isn't absolutely necessary.

# Queen's Condemnation > Honey Drip

## Stage Restriction

Cost <= 3900. The consequence of this is that you cannot use Awakened Bahamut [or normal-price Ubers]

## Must-Have Units

-   **Catellite** - Since the approach here is to outlast the Brollow waves, having Catellite for stalling is a high priority.
-   **Sadako / Octopus** - Serves as a wall that stops Brollows from killing your higher range units. Great unit to bring especially since you're not rushing.
-   **Fishman** - Can one-shot Brollows, and deals good damage to Queen B. Great for chipping almost every enemy on this stage. Thanks to high speed, it can make it into Queen B's blindspot without needing too much timing.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Can Can, preferably with Speed Up** - Damage output is good for cleaning up all kinds of peons, although performance without speed up isn't very remarkable.
-   **Maglev** - Kills a single peon, and gives double bounty. Good to stop Queen B from pushing just after The Sloth attacks, and reduces pressure during Brollow waves.
-   **Vendor** - Can knockback The Sloth, helping you to recover ground.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Ubers with <=3900 Cost and Decent Speed:** Gigavolta, Divine Twinstars, etc.

[Video](https://youtu.be/pQdLl-3lTuk)

The Speed combo is optional, and doesn't do a whole lot, so I removed it in the video. Use Vendor instead if you want to, or a 2-Slot Health / Defense / Speed combo. The purpose of most units is the same as the previous stage, except this approach relies very heavily on Catellite and Fishman.

Stall Queen B on the enemy base with Catellite and Fishman, till the first Brollow wave. Lure the Brollows to the base, and send basically everything at them. Once this is done, The Sloth should be behind Queen B; and your units will knock back Queen B. At this point try and get Worker Cat to ~level 6, and play defensively. Catellite spam is great, send Fishman as he recharges. Octopus and Can Can can be sent less frequently. Reserve Maglev to retain your ground when The Sloth attacks / for Brollow waves. After the first two-three waves the Brollows die down, and you can beat down the bosses.

# Queen's Condemnation > Royal Jelly Hell

## Stage Design

The stage contains Queen B paired Cyberhorns, Dark Otters, and Wall Doge - with all peons spawning at a relatively slow rate. Arguably easier than the two stages that come before it.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is important to kill Cyberhorn before Queen B gets to your base.
-   **Corrupted Psychocat / Seafarer** - Crowd Control units are important for stalling Cyberhorn. Note that true formed Psychocat makes a significant difference, and Freeze Up Seafarer is great here too. Alternatively, Can Can with Target Alien talent works too. Either of these three will be good, but bringing more is always welcome.
-   **Chill Cat** - For busting down Cyberhorn quickly.
-   **Bombercat** - To stop Dark Otter so your other units can kill it.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Fishman** - For rushing Queen B, preferably before having to fight the second Cyberhorn.
-   **Power Saw** - Same use as Chill, except does slightly better damage for it's cost. Cooldown is high though, so only put it in a filler slot.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Alien / Generalist Rushers:** Meow-sketeer / Valiant D'arktanyan, Li'l Valkyrie / Li'l Valkyrie Dark, Divine Kalisa, etc.
-   **Melee Units with High DPS:** Immortal Yukimura, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

Uses BioBone to get more value out of Chill, among other units. You can also try out Crazed Wall if you have extra slots.

Send one Fishman immediately [this isn't done in the video, but other guides do it and it's a good idea]. This will stall Queen B for a while, and buy you some time to build a stack on cyberhorn later [he'll also kill the first Wall Doge, which makes stacking a bit easier]. Lure Cyberhorn to base, then send everything you have on him. By the time Queen B arrives, Cyberhorn should be dead. Try to Cannon Cancel her attack [this isn't easy, so don't fret if you can't do it]. Try to get a few units into her blindspot, and attempt rush similar to the original stage. Bahamut should also enter her blindspot once his Slow expires, which will help too.

# The Old Queen > I'll Be Bug

## Boss

Queen Mother V, has the same range and attack frequency as Queen B, but inflicts Curse instead of Slow.

## Stage Design

Features 2 200% magnification Professor As spawning at a long interval, with waves of peons in between; consisting of Ginger Snache, Relic Doge, and One Horn. Getting hit by curse makes your anti-reds substantially worse against Professor A. So, some seriously good timing is required here.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Manic Island** - Comes in use for chipping Professor A, killing peons, everything. Any level lower than 40 will struggle to survive for long enough, unless you have strong up combos.
-   **Roe** - Your primary tank. You’ll use this to hold back the enemies while your other units keep coming and dying.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - For attacking Professor A, preferably landing multiple hits while doing so.
-   **Bullet Train** - For killing Ginger Snache and Relic Doge, can also be used to chip Professor A if needed. Great as you don’t really need to time it to work.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Cutter** - Does the same damage as an Awakened Bahamut hit to red enemies once strengthened, although it doesn’t always land in a hit. 41s cooldown is half that of Bahamut, which means you get more opportunities when you bring both.
-   **Can Can** - Great for killing One Horn, stalling it with slow, and killing Relic Doge.
-   **Island** - Works as a second M.Island. Especially good if you’re bringing Strong Up Combos.
-   **Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent)** - Good for stalling / slow chipping if you manage to have 2 Prof. A on the field, at which point most of your units won't be able to hit them. Stands outside Relic V range if any other enemies are at front.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Cutter Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/queen_v_intro_lineup1.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/gvrG6fo3jE0)

BioBone is great on this stage. With Research Up M, Roe’s deployment time becomes exactly twice of Queen Mother V’s attack cycle. This means that once one Roe gets in her blindspot, future Roes will also get in, if you time them the moment they recharge. If you aren’t very good at timing, BioBone is for you. Power Cutter and Li’l Brave Cat have an Attack Up Sm Combo, which is great to have [for a cheap slot count].

Use Cutter and Bullet Train in the startoff as shown to get some cheap damage on Professor A. Lure Queen V close to your base (but not hitting), wait out for a while to build up money, and then send Bahamut. Once you get 2 KBs, the first One Horn should be in front. Beyond this point, the strat is relatively flexible. Try to get knockbacks on Professor A with Power Cutter / Bahamut when you can. Time your units to make sure they’re roughly at the same position as Roe when Queen V attacks. This will make your timings consistent. Once the first Professor A dies, your win is practically guaranteed.

[Video](https://youtu.be/FOC-Q2STdXk) - courtesy Yohane

[Uses Rich Cat] This strat is like the previous one, with Research Up M and Strong Up Sm. It focuses on landing 2 Bahamut hits just after Prof. As first KB. After that, it stalls till the second Prof. A comes. Rather than using Bahamut to rush down the first Prof. A, it’s kept reserved for the 2x Relic Doge Wave.

**Strong Up Combos Strat**

[Video](https://youtu.be/W2d0fLGwRXw) - courtesy Anthony

This strategy stacks Combos (Strong Up Sm + M / Defense Up Sm) to increase the value you get out of Manic Island. Since it lacks BioBone, it requires good timing from the player. You can bring regular Island too if it’s levelled enough. You could try this out if you have the monthly cats needed for the combos. See Yohane’s dual Islands version [here](https://youtu.be/wZ1oZ0O1iJ0).

# Dead on Debut > Parade of the Dead

## Boss

Daboo of the Dead is an omnistrike pusher boss, with a standing range of 300 and a maximum range of 800. He has an enormous 3 million HP with just three knockbacks. On top of that, he has immunity to most status effects, making him a big slowly pushing wall. He deals 30000 damage every 13s, which can one-shot meatshields and a lot of other units. Worst of all, he inflicts a crippling 10s long Slow to anything he hits, making it more difficult to get to him.

## Stage Design

Daboo spawns almost immediately on a timer, followed by a Zroco. Enemies cycle involving Angelic and Zombie peons, including Heavenly Hippoe, Angelic Gory, Zory, and Zir Zeal. After 2-3 waves of both traits the peons die down, giving you a clear shot on Daboo.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is very important to rush down the Angel peons, otherwise they can be a massive nuisance to kill.
-   **Shigong** - Survives two Daboo hits, is Slow immune. Great for dealing with Zombie peons as well.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Can Can** - Solid DPS, good bulk, double bounty with talents helps too.
-   **Ramen** - Solid at stalling Angels, allowing your other units to kill them.
-   **Courier** - Moves fast and deals decent damage to enemies. 

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Zombies:** Subterra Sentinels, BCS Tigerclaw.
-   **Tankers:** Divine Kai, Almighty Hades, Mighty Aegis Garu, etc..
-   **One-Hit Wonders:** Exceptionally great here thanks to solid range, great bulk, great DPS, and Slow Immunity on top of it all.
-   **Rushers / Melee:** Immortal Yukimura, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

[+ Sniper]

[Video](https://youtu.be/Q6RAgsM-Fu4) - courtesy Lucas IV

BioBone makes Ramen and Shigong considerably better at their job, and also helps other units. Having Sniper goes a long way. The lineup looks a bit different in the video but it is effectively the same as what you see here.

Sniper can be kept on for the entire duration of the run. Send off a Manic Mohawk to bait a Daboo hit. Send meatshields and attackers at a gradual rate to build up money. When the Heavenly Hippoes arrive, send Can Can and pretty much whatever else you have. Awakened Bahamut can be kept reserved for Heavenly Hippoe waves. Use Holy Blast to interrupt Daboo attacks if you have it, otherwise regular cannon works too. Try and keep a decent amount of money in your wallet, and fight out the peon waves. A few minutes later the peons will die down and you should have an easy win.

# Dead by Encore > Prisoner's Progress

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Costs: >= 1200. Disallowed Costs: < 1200. Since the regular strat relies heavily on Ramen and Shigong, this makes a massive change to your approach. Rather than relying on meatshields to hold the front line, you'll need Titans or Ubers.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Zombies:** One-Hit Wonders, Subterra Sentinels, BCS Tigerclaw.
-   **Tankers:** Divine Kai, Almighty Hades, Mighty Aegis Garu, etc..
-   **Rushers / Melee:** Immortal Yukimura, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

>Due to the nature of this stage, Ubercarry is heavily recommended. Most non-ubercarry strats are impractical. If you're interested in beating it uberless for whatever reason, boosted Jamieras and Islands are the way to go. If you don't have those, Dark Lazer gets the job done as well.

**Talented Dark Lazer Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/daboo_wrath_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[+ Rich Cat, Sniper]

[Video](https://youtu.be/jLjmRNTaz_E)

Talented Dark Lazer is mandatory, although you won't be spamming her all the time as you might be used to. Rich Cat is needed to sustain her because this stage is stupidly cash tight. Sniper is also needed to get Daboo off of your base, and helps to delay his attacks in general. Pizza works because it's pizza, and Roe is basically the only meatshield / wall that you have.

Try and play conservative. Dark Lazer can drain your money super quickly if you aren't careful. Save up your money for Bahamut during the Angel waves, and your Holy Blast for the Zombie waves [first Zory doesn't count]. As long as you're above 10k cash when no peons are around, you should be fine. When they do spawn, send pretty much everything that you have. Balancing between saving ground and saving money is the key to this stage.

# Dead by Encore > March to Death

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with a few Metal One Horns for cash. About a minute in, Daboo spawns, accompanied by some Metal Doge. Metal Doge continue to deploy throughout the stage at a gradual rate. Eventually, a couple Super Metal Hippoes spawn, followed by a Sir Metal Seal after some more time. The combination of Metal enemies and Omni Pushers is very lethal, and this stage is a prime example of it.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Crazed Moneko** - Crit Up M combo raises crit rate of your attackers by 2%, which is very helpful.
-   **Waitress / Soba** - Deals solid damage to the Sir Metal Seal, and also to Super Metal Hippoe. Guaranteed crit is also valuable here.
-   **Puppetmaster / Mochi** - Disposable CC. Enemies will push like hell without them.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Cameraman** - AoE Crit can be humongously helpful for the Super Metal Hippoes. A crit from Cameraman can take off anywhere from 60% [at level 40] to 100% [at level 69] of the SMHs HP.
-   **Noodle** - Good ranged meatshield, occasionally kills Metal Doge.
-   **Catyphoon** - Great for clearing up Metal Doge, but the cooldown is rather long.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Critical Hitters:** Paladin, Hayabusa, Nanaho, Lufalan Pasalan.
-   **Anti-Metal Tankers / Proc:** Poseidon, Sakura Sonic, Gudetama Machine.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Cameraman Crit Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/daboo_revenge_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[+ Rich Cat]

[Video](https://youtu.be/U0GSX7OuStU) - courtesy Lucas IV

Crit Up combo is pretty much compulsory to get Cameraman crits. Manic Jamiera can be substituted for Bahamut, but both are decent. Holy Blast is ideal for this stage, unless you have a levelled Waterblast for whatever reason. Catasaurus is also a functional critter, but not really recommended here. Alternative approach with talented Riceball is seen [here](https://youtu.be/mWjL5ml-zhs).

Start off with Waitress, then send Crazed Moneko after a bit of a delay. Afterwards spam Manic Eraser and Noodles, along with Catornado. These should take care of the Metal One Horns and bring in some money. Try to get Manic Jamiera / Awakened Bahamut in before the Super Metal Hippoe arrive to deal some damage to Daboo.

When the SMH arrives, stop spamming Noodle and Catornado, as they'll only prolong the fight. Waitress and Cameraman will be reliable, and no harm in sending CMoneko along with them. Send Puppetmaster and / or Mochi for Crowd Control, and try and time your faster units. If you're lucky, you'll land a Cameraman crit and make the fight much easier. Try to use a well-timed Holy Blast here to buy you some time.

For the Sir Metal Seal phase, you'll probably be fighting real close to your base. This is okay, and it makes timing a bit easier too. Cameraman isn't super reliable here, but if you have the money you can send her anyway. Waitress will be a consistent source of good damage, and you can always try your hand with C. Moneko [and even regular Moneko] here. This is a "Do or Die" sort of situation so you want to send everything you got.

Once the SMS is dead, you should have a clear win. Bringing Rich Cat is mandatory for this stage, and Sniper is helpful for the cleanup [but far from needed]. Unfortunately, this stage is _very heavily_ RNG dependent, and can waste a ton of Rich Cats [I speak from experience]. Be prepared to sink some resources here if you're not boosted.

# Papuu's Paradise > Saintly Sister

## Boss

Heavenly Herald Papuu [Angel] deals 4000 Damage per hit, with 40% extra toxic damage on top of it. With her tremendous Omni range, she'll be almost always hitting your base. She strengthens to 3x at 30% HP, becoming much more deadly. She also has immunities to every negative effect except Curse and Sniper KB, both of which greatly debilitate her.

## Stage Design

The stage is relatively short, and Papuu spawns nearly immediately; followed by two Sir Rels. Following this, there are a few peon waves with weak Dagshunds and Wall Doges. After three Dagshunds and a few Sir Rels, the peon flow mostly stops, allowing you to get clean hits on Papuu. Overall, a very easy stage with the right lineup and approach.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Can Can** - Big damage, one shots Sir Rels at level 41 or higher. Also great for killing basically every other peon, and survives two Papuu hits.
-   **Bullet Train** - Secondary Sir Rel killer. Works great to kill peons when they're close to your base, or to snipe them while Papuu is attacking.
-   **Manic Island** - Great for killing peons. Survives two Papuu hits, and has enough endurance to tank a Sir Rel hit. Deals great damage too.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Great for damaging Papuu quickly, especially if you're bringing Curseblast.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Riceball** - A little bit more bulk than Manic Eraser, plus Toxic Immune. Great for the stage if you can afford the NP.
-   **Slime** - Not the most accessible unit for this stage, but a great pick. Big wave damage good for killing peons [obviously].
-   **Ramen** - Great bulk for tanking Papuu hits, and good for chipping her when peons aren't around.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Ubers that can Curse Papuu:** [Dark Kasli](https://youtu.be/r_22jAQNV2Y), Kinrangers Gigaforce
-   **Toxic Immune:** [Almighty Hades](https://youtu.be/TTZRjEyWHuI), Lasvoss Reborn
-   **Rushers:** D'arktanyan, Li'l Valkyrie, Immortal Yukimura, etc.
-   **Balrog:** Balrog

**Curseblast Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/papuu_intro_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Level 10 Base Defense, Sniper]

[Video](https://youtu.be/tjzpmUtevLM)

Base Defense Combo allows you to survive Papuu hits for longer, especially if your base isn't fully upgraded. If you don't need it then you can try an Attack Up combo instead. Green Shell can be swapped out for Eraser, both are decent here. Ramen is also a staple for this stage, but I chose to not bring it. Curseblast and Bahamut are mandatory for this setup. There's another lineup with no Sniper and Pizza instead of Slime in the video, you can check that out if you want.

Use Manic Eraser to bait out a Papuu hit, and lure Sir Rel close to your base. Wait out the first Dagshund, lure it to base, and kill it with whatever you have. Now that you have a gap, send Bahamut. Use Curseblast to take an extra hit, and utilise Shell / BTrain to protect your Bahamut from Sir Rels. Sniper will also help you do extra damage if you have it. Rinse and Repeat. If you have enough base HP [which you should if you didn't let any enemies hit your base], send the second Bahamut after the last Dagshund, and just after Papuu falls into strengthen range. At this point, it should be an easy win.

# N-1 Grand Prix > King Wahwah's Revenge

## Boss

King Wahwah stands at 600 range with omni-strike up till 1000. He deals 24000 damage per attack cycle distributed into three equal multi-hits. He has a million HP with 25 KBs, making him relatively easy to knock back [if you can reach him]. All his attacks have guaranteed KB effect. Lastly, he's pretty slow, with just 5 Speed.

## Stage Design

The stage features Wahwah with minimal peons. These include Scissoroo, Zang Roo, Shadow Boxer K, Ottas, and some Doge variants. Not that difficult to handle, but the restriction...

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Rarities: Normal, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: EX, Rare, Super Rare. This leads to a situation where 99% of players will be using heavy Ubercarry for this stage.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

Note: This aboutList is not comprehensive.

-   **Spammable Attackers:** Kasa Jizo, to a lesser extent Momotaro.
-   **Tankers:** Divine Kai, Almighty Hades, etc. Bonus points if they're KB immune.

-   **Anti-Zombies / Anti-Aliens:** Eva Unit-01, One-Hit Wonders, Bazibastra, etc.
-   **Epicfests:** Dark Kasli, Valiant D'arktanyan.

**Endurance Setup**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/wahwah_wrath_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

An incredibly straightforward stage. Kill peons and live. You shouldn't have any trouble lasting till the end of the enemy waves. I don't see any need to see a video for this one.

# King Wahwah's Return > Wrath of the Dogelord

## Stage Design

This stage focuses on a peon-spam approach, similar to CotC Broton. Kroxos, Mr. Angels, Ginger Snache, Trolly Bloggers, and Brollows can be seen in the enemy roster.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Slime** - Insanely good for clearing peons, especially if boosted.
-   **Slapsticks / Seafarer / Pizza** - Stackable and affordable AoE DPS with enough bulk to take a beating form Wahwah.
-   **Cyborg** - Fast enough to work [unlike Cameraman], decent range, decent damage, stackable. Cost isn't an issue as the stage has basically infinite money.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Cyberpunk** - Can come in clutch towards the end, by slowing Wahwah while you're fighting Brollows.
-   **Bullet Train** - Excellent for keeping Wahwah pinned to base in startoff and fetching some money. Fails later on due to the peon spam nature of the stage, though.
-   **Green Shell** - Knockback immunity allows it to stall Wahwah for some time.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Kasa Jizo:** Kasa Jizo.
-   **LD / Wave attackers:** Cats in the Cradle, D'artanyan, etc.

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/wahwah_revenge_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/OkpzuEURH-w)

Use Bullet Train to pin Wahwah in the startoff and get some cash. When the Mr. Angels come out, start sending your attackers and meatshields. Afterwards, it's more or less a CPU strat. Keep your Cyberpunk saved for when you're pushed to your base. Bring Thunderbolt to enable slime to land hits more consistently, and keep an eye on your money. This is a straightforward stage, although not that easy with low levels.

# Wanwan's Glory > Dogsville

## Boss

Everlord Wanwan has omni and multihit, with the same build as Lord Wahwah. The difference being, his third hit carries a one-minute long warp instead of knockback; and does only 1500 damage.

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with Wanwan immediately, followed by some Relic Doge. Around a minute in, one Capy spawns. Another Capy spawns some while later. Peons include Relic Doge, Sir Rels, Croconators, and Mistress Celeboodles. This stage has a cat limit of only 10, which is challenging because of Wanwan's warp. It limits your meatshielding ability, and makes the enemies push more. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for this stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Great for damaging Capy IF you're not using any other uber for the same job.
-   **Slime** - Can knock back Wanwan from a distance. Great at getting him off your base, especially when fighting Capies. Also chips hordes of peons much better than other options [if timed well].
-   **Can Can** - One-shots Sir Rels at level 41, and deals solid damage to Relic Doge. Tanks a lot of damage and repositions frequently. On top of that, he has warp immunity, making him phenomenally useful here.
-   **Manic Lion** - Fast attack rate is great for killing Croconators. Preferred over crit units because of his short cooldown, and ability to act as a secondary meatshield.
-   **Bullet Train** - Great for getting peons off your base if they're putting pressure [especially Sir Rel].

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Cutter** - Does big damage to Capy if it can land a strengthened hit. Even one strengthened hit can make your life much easier, especially for the second Capy. You can also use it for combo kills on Sir Rels with BTrain / Slime, but this is not recommended outside of emergencies.
-   **Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent, preferably Max Survivor)** - Can slow Wanwan for a distance, which can stall him for long if followed up with a knockback from Slime [or from Cyberpunk's own damage]. You can also use him to slow down Capy and fight a bit far from the base. Whichever way you choose to use him, he's a great pick for this stage.
-   **Catellite** - Warp Immune meatshield that helps to keep cat limit empty. Can also clear Those Guys, which helps your other units [Can Can / BTrain] miss less often.
-   **Stone** - Warp Immunity with tremendous HP and suicide allows Stone to stall very effectively here.
-   **Courier** - Courier is great for chipping Capy due to his LD reach and high DPS output. 

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Reds with Solid DPS:** Pai-Pai DX, Headmistress Jeanne, [Eva-02](https://youtu.be/S2pvcw2tJ04)
-   **Warp-Immunes:** [Bazibastra](https://youtu.be/RbLdglhV6Vc), Li'l Valkyrie, Dark Kasli, Meowsketeer / [Valiant D'arktanyan](https://youtu.be/2rf8LB_HzVY), etc.
-   **Great Generalist Rushers / Melee:** Yukimura, Balrog
-   **Chun-Li:** Can potentially pin Wanwan to the base with a [proper setup](https://youtu.be/Z-mWMQ1I6jA).

## Lineups and Strategies

Note: There are cheese strats for this stage using either Healer or Seafarer. You should avoid these, because the setups are too elaborate and RNG reliant / need immensely difficult timing.

**Double Bullet Train Warp Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/wanwan_intro_lineup1.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/HghRkADKOD4)

Just a heads up, this guide uses Jiangshi, both with and without talents, in different lineups. If your Jiangshi isn't talented using Catellite is just as good. Jiangshi is a decent pick because high speed, and because he saves Cat Limit thanks to survivor. The stage isn't too cash-intensive either. Pizza and Can Can are there for general DPS, and the rest of the lineup is obvious. There's another lineup with NEO Cutter in this video, refer to that if you have the unit.

This does have some timings to master. Immediately send Bullet Train, don't even upgrade worker. After BTrain hits base you can upgrade worker to 2 [but not 3]. As soon as Wanwan spawns, send Manic Eraser and Can Can, in that order. When BTrain recharges, deploy MEraser. as soon as MEraser recharges, send BTrain again [this is just for timing, so that BTrain hits Wanwan after his first multi-hit]. Ideally it will hit Wanwan and get warped, but if it doesn't hit him that's okay too.

After this point, lure the enemies. Handle the peons as you want, just make sure you don't push too far from your base. When the Capy comes, use Bahamut to damage him, and send the other damagers that you've brought. If all goes well, both the warped bullet trains will arrive and interrupt Wanwan, buying you time to rush Capy. This is a very chaotic stage, so you might not get immediate results even with the correct approach.

In between Capies, you should try to gain ground. Push back Wanwan with well-timed slimes, Can Can, Bullet Train, and Manic Lion. You can send Cyberpunk here, or when the second Capy comes. When the second Capy comes to the field, send everything that you got. It's tough, but once that's done the stage is over. Remember to prioritise getting as many Slime hits as possible. They knock back Wanwan, deal good damage to all peons, and buy you time for other units to attack.

More important than WHAT to do in Wanwan, is WHAT NOT to do. There are many pitfalls in this stage, and even expert players will fall for them from time to time. Without go into too much detail, remember these few points.

-   Do NOT send Slime unless Wanwan has just finished attacking, it will just die.
-   Do NOT spam all meatshields rapidly. You will clog up the Cat Limit.
-   Do NOT panic. Everyone makes mistakes, and with Slime it isn't too tough to recover from them.
-   Do NOT be impatient. If you spam everything, there's a good chance some of your units will get warped.
-   Do NOT let the Sir Rels live. Prioritise killing them as quickly as possible, through whatver damage combo you can get. Reserve Bullet Train / Green Shell for them if you need to. They will tear through your meatshields if you're not careful.

**Standard Bullet Train Warp Strat**

Uses Manic Island for killing peons, a perfectly acceptable alternative to Pizza. Both of them have a tendency to get warped, but Manic Island's fast attack rate and solid DPS make him a great pick for this stage. It uses only a single Bullet Train warp, which is a bit easier to time. Other than that, the basic principle and strategy is the same as the previous lineup.

**Research Up Strat**

[Video](https://youtu.be/mRHF31eG4g4) - courtesy Anthony

Relies on Elemental Duelist to damage Capies. Research combos help both Slime and Elemental Duelist. Otherwise very similar to the previous two strategies. Can Struggle with Relic Enemies compared to the other two lineups, but faster at rushing Capy.

# Clionel Ascendant > No Plan A

## Boss

Cruel Angel Clionel stands at 600 range, with an LD reach of 400~1200. She deals 32000 Damage in a single hit, and attacks every 4.8s. She has 2.4M HP with just 4 KBs. While her blindspot is large, she's almost always featured with support enemies which fill it up, making her a forbidable foe.

## Stage Design

The stage features the deadly duo of Clionel and Sleipnir. Clionel's blindspot of 400 is almost completely covered by Angelic Sleipnir, leaving no safe zone for any cats. This makes the combo difficult to fight without any specific strategy. Additionally, there are Trolly Bloggers who can push your units into Clionel's range, and Angelic Gories who plow through your defenses.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is a must-have for rushing the Angelic Sleipnir.
-   **Ramen** - Almost mandatory for stalling Angels, especially the Angelic Gory waves.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Maglev** - Snipes Trolly Bloggers for good money, and rebounds on Sleipnir KB, great for chipping it in the startoff.
-   **Manic Macho Legs / Medalist** - Good for cleaning up Trolly Bloggers.
-   **Can Can, preferably with Double Bounty** - Good damage on Angelic Gories.
-   **Seafarer / Pizza** - Also for Angelic Gories. Note that Seafarer's Speed and Survivor ability make him better of the two to bring on this stage.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Disposable Anti-Angels:** Divine Kalisa, Kasa Jizo.
-   **Tanky Anti-Angels:** King Gamereon, Ushiwakamaru, etc.
-   **Yukimura:** Yukimura. Almost no other rushers have viability here.

## Lineups and Strategies

The video is new, goes well in depth, and is self-explanatory. There is no need for me to summarize it. Levels used in it are converted to True Form equivalents here.

# Clionel Dominant > New Testament

## Stage Restriction

Cat Limit: 5. This makes a massive difference for obvious reasons, mainly that meatshielding is a whole lot tougher now.

## New Must-Have Units

-   **Maglev** - Great for same reasons as the original, but almost necessary here because the stage is tougher.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Disposable Anti-Angels:** Divine Kalisa, Kasa Jizo.
-   **Tanky Anti-Angels:** King Gamereon, Colossal Benkei, etc.
-   **Yukimura:** Yukimura.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Polished Two Cycle Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/clionel_wrath_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/y81c0JA8wNk)

Attack and Defense combos can be replaced with Resist combos if you don't have the needed units. Base Defense combos are usable here as well. Alternatively, you could try Manic Eraser / Zamboney / Seafarer instead of those. Level 40s are _heavily_ recommended. Can Can and Pizza talents are great to have as well.

Send off a lone MML to kill Bloggers for money. If you've brought Crazed Cow you can use it here as well. When Sleipnir moves in front of Clionel send Maglev. If you're lucky, you'll get 3-4 hits out of Maglev, which will seriously injure Sleipnir. Lure the Angelic Gory, and rush it down with Bahamut. The stage proceeds similar to the original No Plan A afterwards, but the cat limit makes it considerably tighter. Use Seafarer instead of Can Can if yours is missing a lot.

# Clionel Dominant > A Cat Screaming Love

## Stage Design

This stage contains Clionel paired with highly boosted Heavenly Hippoes. It's almost impossible to push through them without having your stack killed by Clionel, and eventually the enemies push to your base [if you're fighting the stage "normally"]

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Mandatory for rush strat.
-   **Zamboney** - Necessary to stall enemies while Bahamut does his Bahamuting.
-   **Roe** - Serves the same purpose as Zamboney.
-   **Well-levelled Slow Beam** - 3~4 is sufficient, but 8~9 would be recommended. Refer to the strat given below for reasons.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Rushers:** Divine Kalisa, Meow-sketeer, Immortal Yukimura, etc.
-   **Melee Units:** Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Slow Beam / Cannon Rush Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/clionel_revenge_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

Slow Beam - [Video](https://youtu.be/hBYsRfwtuBs) - courtesy Lucas IV

Regular Cannon - [Video](https://youtu.be/GhoYZTmPi0Q) approach from Mickey (recreated by Xan)

For Slow Beam approach, Slow Beam level 8~9 is recommended for this strategy, but 3~4 should be sufficient if your timing is good. Manics with lower levels could work, but Zamboney / Roe are mandatory. Needless to say, Ramen works well in place of Mohawk too.

Stall out the two waves of Relic Doge in the startoff however you want. Lucas uses Cameraman here, I prefer Can Can and Maglev. Stall for a while, then send Roe and Zamboney. Send Bahamut just before Zamboney can hit base, and Maglev with him. Timing is essential here, so pay close attention to the video.

Fire Slow Beam on base hit. Do note that Iron Wall can work as well, but it's not mentioned as no one has a levelled Iron Wall. Maglev should hit the Gabriel in the boss wave, making way for Bahamut and Zamboney to enter Clionel's blindspot. If done right, this should be an easy win from here. Keep spamming meatshields and tanks.

Alternatively, you can try which uses the regular cannon, with a startoff focused on Awakened Bahamut. Stall the first Relic Doge wave, then spawn Awakened Bahamut when you see the next Relic Doge wave spawn. Let Awakened Bahamut trigger the boss wave, in turn letting him get knockbacked by Gabriel. Spawn Maglev when no enemies are in front of Heavenly Hippoe, and then fire your cannon when Hippoe is knocked back. You should not spawn Manic Lion until you fire your cannon. 

# Z-Onel Rises > Last of the Dead

## Boss

Death Angel Z-Onel retains the LD reach and attack cycle of Clionel, but now has the Zombie trait instead. She also revives infinite times at 50% HP, and has 1M base HP.This means that she can be quite troublesome if you can't Z-Kill her.

## Stage Design

Features 2 Z-Onels, paired with Zuche, Zoge, Star Peng, Shibalien Elite, and General Gregory. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for this stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Very helpful for rushing down the first Z-Onel, which makes the stage considerably easier.
-   **Slime** - Disposable attacker who can take out Zuche and Zoge conveniently, and helps for chip on tankier peons as well.
-   **Bullet Train** - For killing Zuche before they fuck up your everything.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **A Well-levelled Holy Blast** - Z-Kill snipe strat uses level 18~20 Holy Blast, Li'l Flying / Chadbear strat uses level ~10. Even higher levels are achievable, and the more levelled your cannon is the easier this stage gets.
-   **Can Can / Chill / Seafarer** - All are good at dealing with the Starred Aliens, but you might not have enough slots for all three.
-   **Li'l Flying / Cadaver Bear** - Allow you to get Z-Kill on Z-Onel if you're not using Holy Blast Snipe strat.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Melee / Mid-range Bruisers / Rushers:** Li'l Valkyrie, Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, etc.
-   **Melee / Mid-range / Disposable Anti-Aliens:** Gravolodon, Bazibastra, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Holy Blast Z-Kill Snipe Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/zonel_intro_lineup1.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/iQ-NmDiMiI8) - courtesy Lucas IV

Seafarer and Can Can's Alien CC Talents are both great to have here, but not compulsory. You might want Chill Cost Down if trying richless, especially since it's used on Puffer Planet as well. Boosted Manic Island isn't that common, you could try Li'l Flying / Cadaver Bear or talented Housewife there instead [even Dancer or Ubers can work]. Holy Blast Level 15+ is mandatory for this lineup, 18+ is recommended.

Start off by luring the Zoge. Kill it and a Zuche with Slime. Lure the Star Peng to your base, then stack attackers on it. By the time Z-Onel comes, the Aliens should be dead. Send Bahamut now. From here on out, it's a number guessing game. Wait for a bit after Z-Onel's third KB, then fire Holy Blast. If you did it right, you should get a Z-Kill. From here on out, you can improvise, and the video goes more in-depth on that.

**Regular Z-Kill Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/zonel_intro_lineup2.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/ufQF8C9lzeo) - courtesy Yohane

This strat works well even with a level 10-12 Holy Blast, but it needs either Li'l Flying Cat [Level 60+ recommended], or Cadaver Bear Cat.

Startoff is almost identical to the above strategy. After dealing with the Star Peng, use Holy Blast to make way for your Li'l Flying stack to enter Z-Onel's blindspot [It's too slow to enter normally]. Afterwards, you kinda just pray that Flying gets the Z-Kill. A higher level Li'l Flying helps. The rest can be improv'd from there on.

# Deeply Dreaming > Bombergirl

## Boss

Bakoo is a Black enemy with 180 standing range, an LD attack ranging from 50 to 1850, freeze with 177% uptime, a 2.83s attack frequency, and 10000 damage. To compensate, she has a very low 4 Speed, and 500k HP with 10 KBs [putting her at a relatively low endurance of 50k].

## Stage Design

A Bore spawns in the startoff. When you hit the base, Bakoo is deployed; along with a Kang Roo and a Bore. Some Wall Doge follow after, and another Bore spawns after a while.

## Must-Have Units

-   **iCat** - Allows guaranteed and effective crowd control for the Bores. With him you can use them as LD stepping stones to kill Bakoo.
-   **Medalist / Vaulter / Cyborg** - Any decent LD unit works really, but these two are great. You could always try Cyborg as well. These will help you to chip Bakoo [and hopefully KB her before she attacks your stack].

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Momotaro:** Works as a substitute for iCat.
-   **Kasa Jizo:** Works as a substitute for LD Unit / Cyborg.

Most other Ubers are unnecessary here, if not counterproductive.

## Lineups and Strategies

**LD Stack Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/bakoo_intro_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/7LVpn2ritlg)

BioBone allows you to get 2 iCats in time if your base HP is low. Otherwise very straightforward lineup.

Lure the Bore close to your base. Send iCat and Crazed Tank. Bore will knock back your iCat once it unfreezes, then you can stall it on your base. Wait till the second iCat. Once two iCats are out, you'll have permafreeze. Stall for money if you want, then start stacking Cyborgs. Once the Bore dies, your iCat stack will hit the base. Fire cannon when this happens to cancel Bakoo's attack. After that, just watch the magic.

# A Deeper Dream > Wrath of the Dreamer

## Stage Restriction

Disallowed Rarities: Special, Super Rare. Allowed Rarities: Normal, Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. No longer having access to iCat or Roe forces a different strategy. While the general idea is the same [CC Bore/s, stack LD / Cyborg], it becomes less consistent in execution.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Dread Pirate Catley** - Your only reliable source of crowd control with these restrictions.

## Great-to-Have Units

-   **Thaumaturge** - Occasionally hits and procs weaken, allowing your other units to live a bit longer.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Momotaro / Ice Cat:** A solid upgrade over Catley in terms of crowd control.
-   **Kasa Jizo:** Can OHKB or 2HKB Bakoo, able to consistently handle her after hitting base.
-   **LD Snipers / Good-ranged anti-Blacks:** Meow-sketeer, Adventurer Kanna, Glorious Amaterasu, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Dread Pirate Catley Strat**

[+ Rich Cat, Sniper]

[Video](https://youtu.be/2UMDpU_30WU) - courtesy Lucas IV

Catley is brought for crowd control. Thaumaturge won't hit much in the startoff but can be useful during the boss fight. Enchantress is not used because her proc sucks lmao. Bring Zamboney if you have it.

Lure the Bore close to base, but not quite hitting. Keep 2-3 Catleys on the field to maintain a stable frontline, then build a stack. If Bore isn't dead but you're close to the enemy base, stop spawning everything and let them die; then start over. Rinse and repeat till the Bore dies, then hit the base. If everything goes right, you'll win. While this strat is quite RNG dependent, it's the best accessible approach we've got.

# A Deeper Dream > Revenge of the Dreamer

## Stage Design

3 Bakoos spawn on this stage at large intervals. Along with them, we get to see two Elder Sloths, and occasionally a few SBKs.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Seafarer** - Can freeze Elder Sloth, which is obviously a good thing. Also a decent generalist.
-   **Bomber** - Freezes Bakoo, also great for Shadow Boxer Ks
-   **Cameraman** - Great as a ranged meatshield, especially with Survivor talent.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Pizza** - Takes care of dealing damage to Black enemies.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Kasa Jizo:** self explanatory.
-   **Melee Tanker / Rusher Ubers:** Immortal Yukimura, Blanka, Cats in the Cradle, etc.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Ranged Meatshielding Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/bakoo_revenge_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/UHT-Gd-WhYs) - Lucas IV

Eraser is only brought for the startoff. Bahamut is used at 36 in the video but 30 is perfectly usable. Pizza Wave, Cameraman Survivor, and Can Can Double Bounty talent are highly recommended. While Seafarer Freeze Up did not exist back then, it's definitely phenomenal here. Legs are optional. Savage Blow on Housewife is good to have too, but far from compulsory. Avoid any short ranged unit unless it has piercing or is Yukimura.

Lure the first Doge Dark to your base, and kill it with Can Can for good money. Send out Seafarer and Bomber to stall for a bit, then clear out the Doge with Pizza. Keep spamming Cameramen and Bombers, save up some money for Bahamut. Once the Gory Blacks are dead, you'll have some respite. The Shadow Boxers are threatening as well, but you should have some money and a good stack by then. Use cannon to interrupt Bakoo's attacks if needed.

# First Errand > Baby Fake

## Boss

Doremi has the same LD range as Bakoo, but is traitless. Additionally, she's considerably faster (14 as opposed to Bakoo's 4), and has higher endurance, much more damage, and a slow instead of freeze proc.

## Stage Design

Startoff consists of an Alpacky with some Mr. Angels for support. After base hit, Doremi spawns with Trolly Bloggers, Mr. Angels, and Director Kurosawah as support.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - gg no re

[Video](https://youtu.be/tpAuI9OwHZw) - courtesy Lucas IV

Bring something that can kill Alpacky. MIsland works but so do 20 other things. Bahamut for reasons that will be clear later. Base Defense combos if you're poor. Attack Up combos also work well here.

Kill Alpacky and stall for max cash. Then hit the enemy base. Use something weak like a meatshield to do so. This will leave a Mr. Angel to rush forward. Lure Doremi to your base, and send Bahamut to hit the Mr.Angel. Before Doremi attacks, use the cannon to stall her and clear out the Trolly Bloggers, with Bahamut now hitting Doremi. This should line up Bahamut to hit both Doremi and the Mr.Angels without either hitting the base. After 20 some repeats, Doremi is dead. GG. See video with the pinned comment for more specific details.

# River Styx > Realm of Carnage

## Boss

Hannya is a red variant of The Face, with an enormous 800 range. She also cripples all units to 25% Attack with her weaken, and has an attack frequency of 5s. She deals 36k damage with one attack, which can one-shot many units, including Awakened Bahamut.

## Stage Design

Hannya spawns almost immediately on a timer, followed by a Bore. About a minute later, R. Ost spawns, and these two enemies keep cycling. Ginger Snache are sent intermittently, with Sir Seals appearing as well later on.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Awakened Bahamut is used against either Hannya or R.Ost, depending upon the strategy. Either way, he's a mandatory unit.
-   **iCat** - Mandatory for the rush strat, great to have for regular approach too. Makes stalling the Bore easy, and can permafreeze Hannya when stacked. Speed is a bit of an issue, but this can be fixed with Speed / Research combos or Speed Up talent.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Can Can** - Solid DPS, good crowd control for Bore.
-   **Roe** - Stalls Bore consistently allowing your other units to proc on it. Can also weaken Hannya, allowing your units to tank a hit from her in case ICat permafreeze fails.
-   **Crazed Whale / Elemental Duelist** - Anti-Red DPS.
-   **Courier** - Fast anti-red DPS that hits both Bore and Hannya effectively. Also great for clearing out Ginger Snache. 

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Reds:** Eva 02, Pai Pai, Ice Cat.
-   **Certain Weaken-Immunes:** Balrog, to an extent Lasvoss.
-   **Epicfests / General rushers:** D'arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Divine Kalisa

## Lineups and Strategies

Note: An approach involving Bahamut Chaining on R. Ost is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it. Most lineups that can make it work will work better with a conventional Rush.

**General Rush Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/hannya_intro_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?aboutList=PLRLFn2k4qKxM3A-_4NUVwJSJoNWigJZBt) - courtesy Waran-Ess

BioBone helps to rush down the Bore quickly, and allows you to get more iCats, which means more chance of permafreeze lasting for the full rush. The rest of the lineup should be self-explanatory. The playlist also has lineups with Freeze Up combos, Speed Up combos, and a setup without Sushi. Alternatively, you can try your luck with [iCat Speed Up talent](https://youtu.be/L1HdKqJE5ag).

Lure the first Bore up close, throw everything you got at him except Bahamut. The Bore should die just before Hannya gets up close, and your Sushis will take a hit. After that, you should get a permafreeze from iCat, and you can start Bahamut chaining. If all goes well, Hannya will be dead before the R. Ost arrives. You can use Thunderbolt cannon to stall her if she unfreezes, and the Weaken from Sushi will allow your units to tank a hit from her, if needed.

**Courier Endurance Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/hannya_intro_lineup2.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/a3utaQJHFfI) - courtesy Xan

This lineup uses BioHazard along with Moby Dick. BioHazard gives a research boost, which is useful for spamming Courier more often, while also giving a boost to Can Can and Crazed Whale. Moby Dick's HP boost can be replaced with another HP Up or Strong Up Combo. Courier handles Ginger Snache, while Crazed Whale's DPS helps for Bore. Can Can provides CC. Hannya is chipped with occasional Courier hits, and Bahamut later on. Sniper is not used in this video, but it can be great at gaining ground. Turn it off whenever you lure R. Ost though.

Rather than luring, this strat involves starting the fight far off from the base. Use most of your attackers except bahamut, but be a bit judicious with Courier usage at the start to keep a decent amount of money. The Bore should be gone before R. Ost spawns. Stall the R. Ost for some time, then lure it to the base. Bahamut chain the R. Ost as shown in the video. If you've timed it right. You could get a couple Bahamut hits on the second Bore as well. You'll need to stall the second R. Ost as well till Bahamut recharges, but after it dies you should have an easy win. 

# River Acheron > Wrath of Carnage

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Rarities: Normal, Special, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: Rare, Super Rare. This makes the stage considerably tougher, since a lot of the units you rely on are Rares and Super Rares [iCat, Roe, Elemental Duelist, Crazed Whale]. There are two distinct ways of beating this stage. One is having decently levelled Normals, and the other is Ubercarry. Most people stick with the latter.

## Must-Have Units [Uberless, no EX Talents]

-   **Awakened Bahamut** - For rushing down R. Osts.
-   **Boosted Island** - Anti-Red tank / DPS. Stops the Bore from shredding your frontline since you don't have access to Manic Eraser. Also good for chipping Hannya, even through weaken.
-   **Boosted Eraser** - Meatshield.
-   **Boosted Li'l Island** - Same purpose as Island, but needs slightly higher levels as it has less base stats.

## Talented EX Alternatives

-   **Dark Lazer** - Attack and Defense are must-have, Wave talent is almost necessary, but Weaken Immunity works too.
-   **Ultimate Bondage** - Only needs Defense up talent. Can substitute Islands after this.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Reds:** Eva 02, Pai Pai, Cat Machine, Mer-Queen Ruri.
-   **Melee Tankers / Rushers:** Divine Kai, Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura.
-   **Epicfests / General rushers:** D'arktanyan, Shadow Gao, Divine Kalisa

## Lineups and Strategies

Note: All the approaches to this stage are a bit high-investment. The talents which you use here [Bondage HP/ DL Talents] are expensive, and farming Islands to +30 or such won't give you massive return for the energy investment either [by 2021 progression standards]. Ubercarry relies on having one of a particular set of ubers, so it isn't super accessible. No matter which approach you choose, expect to go out of your way while making a lineup for this stage.

**Boosted Dual Islands Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/hannya_wrath_lineup1.png" width="100%"/><br>

[Video](https://youtu.be/_TPx2EfnPDI) - courtesy Lucas IV

The Strong Up Sm + M / Defense Up Sm combo allow both Islands to take a hit from Hannya without flinching. This is great for maintaining a stable frontline.

Send Islands only in the startoff to kill off the Bore. Try and keep Hannya away from your base. Lure R. Ost and Bahamut chain it. If you wish to chain on your base clear off Ginger Snache first. If you can't kill it in a single chain then chip with Dragons or other ranged units. Stall between Bore and R. Ost waves with Islands. Use erasers for R. Ost. Try and Bahamut chain it if you can. Rinse and repeat till Hannya dies. Curseblast can be good to bring here too, but Breakerblast / Thunderbolt work just as well.

**Talented Dark Lazer Strat**

[+ Rich Cat]

Research and Strong combos are similar in effect. If you have the Seasons of Love combo I'd definitely recommend that. Dark Lazer has Attack, Defense, and Wave talents. Nothing else is talented. Add talented Bondage if you can afford it. Riceball is only for occasionally baiting Hannya hits, I wouldn't recommend it for meatshielding if untalented. Curseblast is used to let Dark Lazer temporarily hit Hannya unweakened.

The video description goes in-depth on the approach, but I'll summarise it here. Start off by spamming Lasers till the first Bore dies. Wait out the first R. Ost and a Ginger Snache wave that comes just after it. Then lure R. Ost to your base and Bahamut chain it [see exact procedure in the video]. Use what you must for the second Bore [I use Ninja as a filler meatshield but it isn't needed if you've brought Island]. The second R. Ost can be Bahamut chained similar to the first, but now Hannya is close to your base so it's a bit more complicated.

# River Acheron > Revenge of Carnage

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with a few Znache. When you hit base, Hannya spawns; starting a few waves of Zombie peons. These include Zroco, Zigge, and Zir Zeal. After a couple minutes the peons die down, and you're free to take out Hannya.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Housewife** - Good range. Slow is helpful against the peons. Can get Z-Kills occasionally [much more potent with Savage Blow talent]
-   **Pizza** - Great mid-range DPS and cash-efficient as well. Especially great if you have his Wave Attack talent.
-   **Maglev and Roe** - Only really there for the cleanup, which can be painfully slow without them.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Shigong** - To stall Zombie peons.
-   **Cyberpunk** - Provides CC from a distance.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Z-Killers with good CD:** Li'l Valkyrie, Mighty Aethur, Sarukani, etc.
-   **Low CD Melee Ubers / Rushers:** Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, Immortal Yukimura, Meow-sketeer, etc.

[Video](https://youtu.be/wpU8MCc0CQM)

Research Combo helps mainly for Shigong. Other units are explained above. Holy Blast helps a lot but it isn't necessary by any means, as the stage is relatively easy.

Send a single Pizza in the startoff to build up money. There's fancier setups for the startoff but this is very straightforward and gets the job done. You should have about worker Level 6 and 5k money in your wallet when hitting base. Afterwards the only real concern is money. Don't send Bahamut outside of an emergency and try to get Housewife Z-Kills [by not sending more of Pizza / Can Can than needed]. This helps to conserve money too. If the third or fourth Zir Zeal end up close to your base you can rush them down with Bahamut as well. Afterwards just pin Hannya with Roe and kill Zrocos with Maglev / Housewife.

# Courts of Torment > The Pure Land

## Boss

Black Okame is a Red / Black variant of Hannya. And before you even try it, she is Freeze Immune. She has 320 Standing Range with omnistrike up till 800. With 24000 damage and a 2.1s attack frequency, she can disable most units that aren't tankers. Even slow bulky units like Island or Pizza struggle because of the knockback. Finally, she has 2.6M HP with just a single knockback, which means you aren't killing her before peons stop cycling [without insane Ubercarry at least].

## Stage Design

Okame spawns almost immediately on a timer, accompanied by a Doge Dark. Doge Dark and Ginger Snache spawn on cycles, along with Gory Blacks. After a couple minutes, the peons die down [there are only 5 Gory Blacks] and you have a free shot on Okame.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Roe** - Pretty much your only way of maintaining a stable frontline.
-   **Manic Island** - Great for both chipping Okame, and giving you some buffer time till your Pizzas arrive to kill Gory Blacks. Also kills Ginger Snache on the side, and help in stalling.
-   **Pizza** - Kills black peons effectively, although he gets stunlocked by Okame if no peons are around.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Cutter** - Can dispose of Ginger Snache immediately, and decent for chipping Okame as well.
-   **Assassin Bear Cat** - Relatively fast, good chance of hitting Black peons, and deals great damage to them.
-   **Talented Box Cats** - Kill Black peons very easily.
-   **Cyberpunk (Max Slow Up Talent)** - Send when Okame is close to your base to gain some extra Crowd Control. Not much else to explain.
-   **Sniper the Deadeye** - Stands outside of Okame's range, and is great for regaining ground.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

Note: Many ubers that would otherwise be great for these traits can suffer greatly on this stage, due to Okame's stunlock. Watch out for anything with high Foreswing or slow Speed, because it will probably not work.

-   **Anti-Blacks [mainly for peons]:** Immortal Yukimura, Kasa Jizo, Legendary Musashi.
-   **Anti-Black / Red KB:** God Emperor Raiden, Immortal Kenshin, etc. These are great for buying ground.
-   **KB Immune Tanks:** Almighty Hades, Divine Kai. These aren't fantastic here, but can definitely be useful for stalling Okame.

[+ Sniper]

[Video](https://youtu.be/2f1yrkFaVMA) - courtesy Kaxzer

This lineup uses two Health Up Sm combos. I've swapped out Wrestling's combo with Cameraman's combo which has the same effect, but is more accessible. You could also try Resist combos if you want. Regular Island is used in this lineup, but I would advise against deploying it [unless yours is +30 or higher, and even in that case it's mediocre due to low speed]. Awakened Bahamut can come in clutch for peons, particularly Gory Black.

Lure the first Doge Dark, and kill it for quick money. The stage is really straightforward afterwards. The peons are too weak for there to be any difficulty. That being said, don't bother with trying to kill Okame quickly; peons will die down before you do it anyway, and you'll end up wasting money. Breakerblast and Sniper are both must-haves, as you heavily rely on them for gaining ground. Sniper the Deadeye is also a decent unit here.

# Courts of Agony > Heaven and Hell

## Stage Restriction

Unit Limit: This stage has a unit limit of 5. While typically a severe restriction, it's not that much of a problem in this stage, as your units typically don't live that long anyway.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Manic Island** - Anti-Red tank / DPS. Can survive enough Okame hits to stay on the frontline.
-   **Roe** - Same role as Manic Island, although more for stalling than damaging.
-   **Bullet Train** - Capable of dealing quick chip damage to kill off peons.
-   **Assassin Bear** - Pizza is too slow for this stage, so Assassin Bear serves as your source of DPS.
-   **Stone** - Stops enemies from pushing after an Okame attack, if you don't have units on the frontline.

## Great-to-Have Units

-   **Cats in a Box** - Box Cats act as a combination of Bullet Train and Assassin Bear, making them excellent for this stage.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Can deal a lot of damage to an enemy wave if it goes out of control. Works best with Rich Cat.
-   **Power Cutter** - Great for an Attack Up Sm combo, and can also kill a snache quickly.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Disposable Tankers / Rushers:**Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle.

The lineup in the video uses level 50s with no items. If you're using level 40 units, using Rich Cat and Sniper is recommended. BreakerBlast allows you to gain ground quickly. While it may be tempting to bring Cyberpunk or Sniper Deadeye, they don't work here due to the low cat limit.

Your biggest enemy here is the Cat Limit. At no point do you want more than two of any unit. Roe and Manic Island are great for stalling Okame, and Bear should be sent just before black enemy waves. Bullet Train can help to clear out Doge Darks. Bahamut is best saved for Doge Dark + Gory Black waves. Stone should be used sparingly, because it can clog up the Cat Limit.

**Box Cats Strat**

[Video](https://youtu.be/phW2ypdUziY) - courtesy Siluman Tomcat

This lineup substitutes Assassin Bear for Talented Box Cats. This makes the stage a lot easier than what it already was. Strong and HP up combos allow Manic Island to live longer and do more damage. Box Cats' weaken and rebound allow them to deal large amounts of damage to Okame.

Use Box Cats to take care of black peons. You could try to add Awakened Bahamut if you wanted. Bullet Train helps for Ginger Snache. If your Breakerblast is underlevelled, make sure there aren't peons in front of Okame when you use it, lest you miss.

# Courts of Agony > Okame's Teahouse

## Stage Design

Okame spawns almost immediately, along with a Miz Devil. In the following three minutes, gradually increasing waves of Miz Devils spawn. Once you're done with them, Miz Devils spawn very sparsely one at a time. At this point you've won.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Roe** - Pretty much your only way of maintaining a stable frontline, same as other Okame stages.
-   **Slime** - Slime is consistently capable of hitting all Miz Devils in a wave, and lands hits more consistently than what one might think.
-   **Seafarer / Housewife / Cyborg** - Any of these are good for taking on Miz Devils, but I personally prefer Seafarer because of his bulk and Survivor ability.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Stone** - great for stalling Okame after she attacks. Stops Miz Devils from pushing too much. Green Shell might also work in its absence.
-   **Cyberpunk** - Stalls Okame, can potentially buy you 4-5 seconds to take out a wave.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - You won't get a lot of value of him, but he can take out a Miz Devil wave and helps for chipping later.

## Lineups and Strategies

**Endurance Strat**

<img src="file:///android_asset/img/advent_stage_lineups/okame_revenge_lineup.png" width="100%"/><br>

[+ Sniper]

This lineup uses two Attack Up Sm combos. You could use Brave Cutter instead of Sister Act, or Cool Japan if you have neither. These combos allow slime to take down most of Miz Devil's shield HP, which makes your life a lot easier.

Lure the first Miz Devil, kill it with Slime + Seafarer. Send Roe, and be somewhat judicious with Roe and Stone usage. Keep a watch for your cash, try to level up your wallet. Slime will take care of the first 2-3 peon waves easily, Seafarers should live for quite a bit. Around the fourth wave, you should have enough cash to send Bahamut, which might help [although it's far from compulsory to use him here]. I send Cyberpunk around the fifth wave, and after that it's an easy win.

# Rashomon > Aku Reincarnation

## Boss

Sathankhamun VIII is an Aku variant of Hannya. He wields 650 standing range with omnistrike up till 800. He has 34000 damage per hit and inflicts slow of 2 seconds. His attack frequency is 4.3s. While Sathankhamun is an Aku enemy, he does not have any Aku Shield. That being said, he's still a nasty pusher.

## Stage Design

Sathankhamun spawns immediately, followed by a Nimoy Bore. A minute later, Chik-ful-a spawns. Alongside it, a Puffington appears. It's best to finish the Nimoy Bore before Puffington spawns. Cerberus kids appear as peons. There are more Chik-ful-as and Puffingtons, but their respawn delay is massive [around five minutes]. By then, you should be done with the stage. Note that the stage is quite long, and somewhat cash-tight.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Seafarer / Chill / Can Can** - Essential for rushing down the first Bore.
-   **Cyberpunk / Stone** - These stop the enemies from pushing immediately after a Rashomon attack (which will knock back everything that it hits).
-   **Slime / Bullet Train / Awakened Bahamut** - There are very few units that can deal significant damage given the amount of DPS on the frontline. These three are realistically the only ones who will land hits, although Fishman has also been reported to be usable.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Idi** - Idi can make quick work of Puffington, and makes this stage much easier.
-   **Doron** - Freezing Puffington gives you a clean easy hit on Chick-ful-a.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Angel Damage-Dealers:** Jizo's Mega-Castle, Divine Kalisa.
-   **Anti-Puffington Tech:** Catman, Greater Balrog, Cats in the Cradle, Immortal Yukimura, Lasvoss.

[Video](https://youtu.be/mRNflJKHHAU)

This lineup uses Sunbathers combo for some extra money at the start. You can use rich cat if you feel the need. Chill cat, Seafarer, and Can Can are good for chipping the Bore at the start. Slime is great if it hits Cerberus Kids, but it needs good timing to work properly. Cyberpunk is there for general crowd control.

Lure the Bore close to your base, then chip it down with everything you got. Don't use stone till you're fighting Sathankhamun, it'll just waste money. Focus on getting rid of the bore quickly, Seafarer Freeze Up and Chill Cost Down talents will help here, alongside Can Can Target Alien. Once the Bore is down, you should be seeing the remaining boss enemies on the field. Time slime regularly for some chip, use Bullet Train + Stone to keep Puffington pinned behind. Cyberpunk should give you some breathing room, and sending Stone immediately after Sathankhamun attacks will reduce the amount of enemy push some more. Use Bahamut on Chik-ful-a whenever you get an opening, and you should be good to go. After the Chik-ful-a is down, you've pretty much won.

"With a single Defense Up Combo, Lv 50 Fishman and Bullet Train can survive a hit from every single enemy here. The same applies to Idi at Lv 40. With two Defense Up Combos, which is what I used, Lv 40 Bahamut can also survive a hit from every single enemy in the stage, but this didn't really do much to me anyway." Besides combos, Blu uses Bahamut for the first Bore [something not feasible in the previous strat as you need him for Chick-ful-a], and he relies on Fishman for chip damage as well. Cameraman is just for combos here.

Since his Fishman has Speed Up talent, it's capable of chipping more conveniently between enemy attacks. Breakerblast is the preferred cannon here to regain lost space. Idi takes out Puffington almost instantly, and the rest proceeds smoothly. This is a faster strategy catered more towards end-game players due to the unit and level constraints.

# Temptation's Symphony > Aku Melody

## Boss

Possessed Empress Cat has a range and attack cycle similar to Nyandam Variants. While Evil Emperor has access to surge, Empress attacks with mini-waves. She also has a practically unbreakable 1.2M HP shield, with 980K HP and 10 KBs.

## Stage Design

There is an enemy limit of 4 (Effectively 3 due to the enemy base). Doge Dark, Aku Doge, Aku Gory, and Heavenly Hippoe spawn on a regular basis. Shadow Boxer K appear as minibosses. Empress spawns 10 seconds into the stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Aku Researcher** - This stage is basically impossible without a Shield Breaker.
-   **Can Can / Pizza / Slime** - Generalists to kill peons quickly.
-   **Bullet Train** - Can be used to snipe peons now and then.
-   **Octopus** - Blocks mini-waves which saves your Researchers.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Ramen / Manic Eraser** - Meatshields that aren't affected if + Levels are sealed.
-   **Awakened Bahamut** - Effective at taking out peon waves.
-   **Stone** - Can stop enemies from pushing after Empress attacks. Especially useful against SBKs.

Researcher is _usable_ for shield breaks. Other Shield Breakers like Ubers or Li'l Jamiera would be preferable. The levels that matter most are Octo tanking an Empress hit when hypermaxed and Bahamut surviving a hit when at Lv 40 with a Defense combo, if you bring it.

Try not to let the enemies hit your base like Blu ended up doing. Save your cash to deal with the SBKs and starting enemies, from then on it is just Aku Doges and Aku Gories, which should be pretty harmless as long as you don't fuck up. Li'l Eraser + Camera combo ended up not doing much in this lineup, so you could switch in some other useful unit like Bahamut to speed up the stage.

# Possessed by Evil > Prelude to Ruin

## Boss

Evil Emperor Cat has a range and attack cycle similar to Nyandam Variants. However, he also has a Level 3 Surge [600~900 range] with a debilitating status effect. He inflicts Freeze for 1.5s [reset by surge], and curse for 4s. The damage from the surge isn't that much [6.7k per hit]. He has 520 standing range with omni-strike that goes till 620. He's somewhat fast for a Nyandam variant with 6 speed and very little backswing. He has 1.2M HP and 8 KBs, so he's relatively easy to push back if you have a clean hit.

## Stage Design

The stage starts off with Emperor almost immediately. Sir Seals, Ginger Snache, Sir Rels, and two Capies feature as peons early on. After some time, Oldhorn appears as the final threat. Once he's down, there's no one protecting Nyandam and you have an easy win.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Slime** - Can damage Emperor from a distance. Also great for chipping Sir Seals / Capies while the Oldhorn is at front.
-   **Can Can** - One shots Sir Rels at level 41 or higher, and deals good damage to Ginger Snache too. Overall a great pick because of solid survivability and damage.
-   **Manic Island** - Works for roughly the same reasons that Can Can does. The boosted DPS against Red enemies also helps against Capy / Sir Seal.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Slapsticks** - Very helpful against Oldhorn if your Can Can / Manic Island aren't levelled enough to take it down by themselves.
-   **Courier** - Fantastic unit for taking out Capy. Can be used to rush the stage. 

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Melee / Rushers:** Greater Balrog, Immortal Yukimura, Cats in the Cradle, Gravolodon.
-   **Surge-Immune Attackers:** Lasvoss Reborn, Kasli the Bane.

[No items used, but Rich Cat helps.] BioBone increases the efficacy of Can Can, Manic Island, and Slime. Dual erasers are used here, and you should stick with regular Eraser even if yours isn't very high levelled. Rest of the units were explained earlier. Awakened Bahamut is decent for chipping Capy but you have to time him right. A well-timed cannon cancel can also help your Bahamut survive longer.

Lure the Sir Rel / Ginger Snache to your base, and try to get Double Bounty on them. Afterwards, keep the fight as far from your base as possible. This will give more ground to deal with the Oldhorn later. Try and time your slimes to avoid Emperor's surge. This takes a bit of practice but can be great once you have it working. Can Can / Manic Island should deal with the enemies just fine, especially if they're boosted. Slapsticks don't help much here, so don't send them. Send Awakened Bahamut somewhere around the second Capy to chip it down.

When the Oldhorn spawns, you should have one Capy dead and at least one KB on the second Capy. If your units are boosted / you played really well, you can get even the second Capy down by now. However, this is not a requirement. You should also have Emperor pushed back to the enemy base. From here on out, send pretty much everything, and pay extra attention to timing your Slimes. Your Bahamut might recharge towards the end of this fight, but you might not have enough money to send him. If your units are levelled enough and your timing / luck are decent, the Oldhorn should be down before your base is being hit. If so, congratulations, you've won.

Cool Japan gives an attack boost which helps for rushing. Can Can and Maglev are useful for dealing damage to Sir Rel and Emperor. Courier's immense anti-red DPS helps to rush down Capy. Bahamut's used for rushing purposes, and the rest of the lineup is self-explanatory. Rich Cat / Sniper could be used but aren't needed.

Lure the Sir Rel / Ginger Snache to your base, and try to get Double Bounty on them. After you have some money, start spamming Courier and meatshields. Sir Seal should die quite quickly, giving you a lot of money. After Emperor's first hit, wait a couple seconds, then deploy Bahamut. You may want to use Cat Cannon to cancel Emperor's attack during the rush. If done well, Emperor will be gone before Oldhorn spawns, and you can do cleanup from there. 

# Bottom of the Swamp > Flow like the Stream

# Top of the Bog > Guided by Currents

## Boss

Kappy stands at 230 range, and deals a devastating 38k damage with each attack. To make matters worse, he has a Level 1 Surge [150~750 range]. He has a decent foreswing [40f], and it's not too difficult to make him miss. If you do lose your stack though, he's going to push a lot due to his 14 Speed. He's traitless, and takes quite a long time to kill [2M HP, 6 KBs].

## Stage Design

The stage features Kappy, paired with a few Scissoroos and Thrillerz. The startoff has a lone Scissoroo with some Thrillerz. On base hit, Kappy spawns with two Scissoroos and some Thrillerz. Scissoroos respawn regularly from now on, and Thrillerz cycle quickly.

## Stage Restriction

Allowed Rarities: Normal, Rare, Uber Rare, Legend Rare. Disallowed Rarities: EX, Super Rare. Guides for both the regular and wrath stage are merged, as they both can use the same lineup.

## Must-Have Units

**Stone** - Great for stalling Kappy. Stone-less strategies exist, but I wouldn't recommend them.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Slime / Tourist / Crystal** - Only necessary for stone-less setups.
-   **Pizza** - Cost-effective bonus damage on top of Cameraman.

3 x Research up Sm combos sync Stone's respawn cycle exactly with Kappy's attack cycle. This allows you to set up a continuous cycle of making Kappy miss. There are stone-less strats too, but they're less consistent [and typically need level 50 Cameraman or higher]. Cameraman is also great on this stage, as it acts as a ranged meatshield. Scissoroo hitting Cameraman makes Kappy miss, preserving the rest of your stack. For the regular stage, you could try Housewife / Seafarer / Pizza in remaining slots. You can also save up some slots by swapping the research combos with uber equivalents [Sm + M or L research combos have the same effect as 3 x Sm combo]. Crystal can work as well.

Stall Scissoroo in the startoff with meatshields. Once you have money, stack Cameraman. After Scissoroo dies, hit the enemy base. Try and have stone land on Kappy during his backswing. This way, you'll set up a cycle of Kappy missing. Keep spamming Stone and send Cameraman as long as you have money. If done well, you'll have a win from here. Thrillerz and Kappy knockbacks can cause interruptions to your Stone rhythm, so you'll need to reset on those. Overall, less complicated than it sounds on paper.

# Top of the Bog > Water Conservancy

## Stage Design

Instead of on base hit, Kappy spawns on a timer in this stage. He's accompanied by Loris and Owlbrows, with Relic Doge and Trolly Bloggers for further support.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Stone** - Great for same reasons as the previous stages.
-   **Fishman / Talented Housewife / Medalist** - Good for clearing Owlbrows.
-   **Slapsticks** - Deals with Relic Doge, and has good survivability.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **Talented Cyberpunk** - Crowd Control can be useful, and he has good survivability, but you might not have the slots for him.
-   **Idi** - _Incredibly_ situational, but could kill Loris a hell lot faster if you time her right. Doron also works but you probably won't have him here.

Rich Cat is highly recommended, although not used in the video. Same drill as the previous stage. Timing Stone is a bit easier here, as you're fighting closer to the base and don't have Thrillerz to worry about. Lure close to the base, stack Slapsticks / Housewife, and watch the magic happen. The stage has a tendency to collapse on you if you make any mistakes, so watch out for that. You might need to let your stack die to restart the stone rhythm, and that's okay.

# Blue Impact > Puffer Planet

## Boss

Puffsley's Comet has a similar build to Brollow, with big damage [40k], full backswing cooldown, and a high KB count [400]. It has 900k HP, with a standing range of 200 and omni-strike till 500. It also has a guaranteed chance to Knockback all units, although this isn't very relevant as there are few cats with above 40k endurance.

## Stage Design

Puffsley's Comet spawns 20 seconds in. It's followed by the first Star Peng. The stage features many more Star Pengs at a rapid respawn rate, along with Three Corporal Weylands and a Project A. After some time the Star Pengs die down, giving you a clean shot at Puffsley. The win-condition of this stage is to outlast the onslaught of Star Pengs. 1500% CotC crystals are mandatory for this stage.

## Must-Have Units

-   **Talented Can Can / Seafarer** - Crowd Control and DPS against the Star Pengs.
-   **Chill with Cost Down talent** - DPS against Star Pengs, allows you to kill one before the next arrives.
-   **Catellite** - Warp Immune meatshield which stops Star Pengs from warping your defenses away. Also tanks a Puffsley hit at level 40 or higher.

## Great-To-Have Units

-   **NEO Saw** - Effectively a combination of Catellite, Green Shell, and Manic Island. Very cost efficient, and great for stalling enemies here.

## Useful Uber Rare Cats

-   **Anti-Aliens:** Bazibastra, Aphrodite, Sharpshooter Saki, etc. Bonus points if they can either tank Puffsley hits or stand far enough to avoid them.

Aerial Recon is brought for Research Up M, and it also includes Saucers within it which is a Massive Damage Up Sm combo [good for Chill]. Bullet Train can deal extra damage if it gets warped, and the Double Bounty is nice to have. Awakened Bahamut is mostly there for cleanup, but you _could_ send him for Star Pengs as well if you had the money [which, you most likely won't]. BioBone and Uber research combos work as well. Cyberpunk in top row also gives IT Crowd when combined with TTraveller [which is an accounting combo], so it can be brought. Seafarer isn't used here, but it's a decent pick, especially if talented.

Start off with a Bullet Train to keep Puffsley temporarily pushed back. Keep spamming Catellite early on with Can Can. Use Chill sparsely early on to save up some money, and avoid Manic Eraser if you can. Once the Weylands come in, the pressure increases. Play aggressively, spam your units. There isn't much depth to this stage. If you play too conservatively though, the Star Pengs will pile up and demolish your defenses. Once the Pengs die down, you've pretty much won. There's infinite Pengs afterwards at a gradual rate, so save up some money for those. Besides that, use Bahamut / Can Can / BTrain for cleanup, and you'll be good to go. Note that boosting your Can Can / Chill makes this stage much more consistent.
