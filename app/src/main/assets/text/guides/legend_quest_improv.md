# Building the lineup

With how random Legend Quest can be, it is vital that you don’t get sloppy when it comes to lineup construction. Take the time to make proper teams, even on the earlier stages; if you get 9 level 1 units and one 75¢ meatshield, you could easily lose to a weak Bun Bun or Master A, even with a full wallet. Of course, you usually win on the 2nd attempt, but early defeats still use up unnecessary stars. With good lineups and decent luck, you can often get as far as level 20 without a single loss.

Now, how do you build a lineup in the first place ? An important point is bringing as many **true counters** as possible. If we use No More Bad Dreams as an example, you could bring the following units:

-   Li’l Eraser, who can cheese the stage
-   Other meatshields (at least 3 more)
-   Cyberpunk or any other potent LD, who can be stacked very easily in the startoff
-   Sanzo / Doctor / Cameraman, as they can work well on their own and/or with a limited number of meatshields.

Avoid heavier units like Ururun or 2nd form Gao, as they need considerable support to actually work on the stage. Ubers that can stall the enemies or take them down very fast (Saber, Kai, Mitama, Jeanne) are still good to bring however.

Remember to bring the right cannon for the stage, as well; it can make a huge difference.

TL;DR build your lineups like you _know_ you’ll lose 8~9 of the units you bring.

# Playing the stage

The most important thing here is **knowing the stage**. Know not only the enemies (which are a given anyway), but also their spawn times, magnifications, synergy, and generally how the stage plays out. Keep in mind that there is no one way to beat a stage, as well. Knowing the basic strategy to a stage can save you a huge amount of defeats and therefore stars.

The next step is **making the most of what units you have**. Immediately when you enter a stage, notice what units got swapped in and figure out how you will use them. Having at least a rough idea of each unit’s stats and role is a massive help, and is even more true for somewhat obscure collaboration units. Good execution can turn a lineup with 9 swapped units into a winning lineup, especially if all your units are levelled up. This is also why you should never reset straight away even with a really bad lineup, unless you know beating the stage is flat impossible (i.e. no Crit units and no cc on Bionic Seaweed, or 9 meatshields and Sanzo on Procrastinator Parade).

Lastly, **get a level 8 worker and full wallet if at all possible**. All those mid-cost mid-cooldown level 1 units can work as supplementary stallers, meatshielding for whatever attackers you may have on the field, and you’ll need money to summon them consistently.

>If you have limited time to react, you can always pause the game and try to think up a decent strat before actually diving into battle.

# Afterword

Even with all this considered, it’s still very much possible to lose on your first, second, or even third try on most of the harder stages. The same advice still applies for subsequent attempts however, and it’s not very common to spend more than 3 attempts on a stage, unless it requires specific units or is hard to beat without a full dedicated lineup (No Return Flights, Shiver Junction, The Holy Exploit, Cubist Crimes, etc.)

Remember to make good lineups, know the stages, know your units, stall for money, be confident and, most importantly, have fun!
