# What are Advent Stages?
Advent stages are stages that run twice a month and drop useful units. These are considerably tough compared to other stages around their level of progression, and feature special boss enemies, exclusive to these stages.
# Why should I beat Advent Stages?
Advents drop some of the best cats in the game, with very unique roles that are almost irreplaceable at what they do. Examples of these include Slime, Bullet Train, and Green Shell, among many others.
# When should I start doing Advent Stages?
There isn’t exactly a ‘correct’ time to start doing advent stages, but it’s normally recommended to start them in mid-SoL; after you have important Gacha rare / super rare True Forms and Awakened Bahamut.
# What order should I do Advent Stages in?
Look at advent stages as and when they come, and see if you’re prepared enough to beat them. If you can’t tell, then ask someone in help channels or the subreddit. There is no well-defined order to do advents in. A lot of them are heavily dependent on a certain gacha cat, and not having that could delay how late into the game you can beat it. Specific uber rare cats also completely nullify the challenge of some advents, so keep an eye out for those too. That being said, the general order of advent difficulty is:

Bakoo < Queen B < Hannya = Daboo < Clionel = Wahwah < Doremi < Papuu < Okame = Emperor < Puffsley < Wanwan = Queen Mother V = Kappy < Z-Onel
# How do I do Advent Stages?
Well that’s why this guide exists. Let’s get right into it. But first...

>## A disclaimer on Unit Levels
>Going through these guides, you might find that the guidemaker's levels do not exactly match yours. It's common to see them use an overlevelled Eraser or Manic Lion and yours isn't quite that high. If the guide uses a Level 34 Awakened Bahamut or a Level 32 Psychocat, it's pretty well understood that Level 30 should be sufficient. I tried to balance levels a bit on my own end while making this, but you might run into some oddballs anyway. 5~10 levels here and there can be typically compensated for by some other means. That being said, guidemakers tend to be rather conservative in this regard, so your levels will most likely be higher than those in the guide.
