This list prioritizes Special, Rare and Super Rare units into groups depending on how important it is to spend Catseyes on boosting them to Level 40/50.

**Notes**

- Cats within one group are listed in Cat Guide order, not most important first.

- Ubers will not be ranked as it depends too much on what you have / don't have. Ask in a help channel for bespoke advice.

- Your mileage may vary depending on play style and preferences. If something is in low here it's because we think most players won't get much use out of boosting it, but if you use it a lot you might find otherwise.
