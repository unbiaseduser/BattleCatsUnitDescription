The contents of this priority aboutList are broken up into:  
  
1. Rare, Super Rare and Special Talents
2. Uber Super Rare Talents
  
Within each list, there are 5 priority levels, in decreasing order of importance  
- Top  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  
- Do Not Unlock

# How This Was Made

A selection of r/bc users (listed in [Credits](#credits)) with considerable game knowledge and experience (The Pin Advisory Team) were asked to score every talent in the game on a scale of 0 - 10, or "X" for detrimental talents. The average scores were used to classify talents into tiers here.

Starting with Version 3.0 of this Pin, we voted for a new rule where the average score of the votes can be overruled by a discussion between 5 or more active Pin Advisory Team members including at least one Strats role. This is to help update scores without having to mobilize many people to change old votes, so as to better represent changes in the team opinion.

For users looking for more information, see the [Appendices](#appendices)

# General Tips

- Try to unlock all or most of the talents in a priority level before moving on to the next one  
  
- Focus on rares and supers first. Roughly speaking, get all the rare/super talents in a tier and possibly most of the next one down before getting the uber talents. Uber talents are less cost effective, and other than the Top Priority ones will have less impact than many Rare/Super talents.  
  
- Special talents are (no pun intended) a special case. Many of the significant ones need to be unlocked alongside at least one of the Stat Buff talents in order to make the talent a viable investment. This of course means they incur a heavy investment compared to Rares or Super Rares where you can just unlock an ability and be done. As a result, we recommend only investing in Special Talents when you have already obtained most of the cheap Rare/Super talents in a tier (such as Target traits) and are ready to spend a lot of NP on improving them.  
  
- Relic target / curse resist or immune are to be unlocked only once in or approaching the end of SoL and beginning of UL. Surge Immune or Toxic Immune talents are similarly not to be unlocked until late game, if at all, as this is when threats with these abilities even appear.  
  
- Some talents are controversial, meaning some people find them much more or less valuable than the average shown, or some people think it is detrimental while other score it somewhat highly. Read the Controversial Commentary in the Appendices for some details on why talents are rated this way, and when you should/shouldn't get them. Judge accordingly, and ask in help channels if you are unsure about your particular situation.

- Stat buff talents are more valuable at high level, most of the time they are only worth unlocking once a unit is boosted if at all. For atk buff in particular, you usually want other attack-focused talents like strengthen or savage blow first.  
- Do not unlock talents in the "Do Not Unlock" category. These usually make your cat worse, not better, and cannot be reversed!
