These lists indicate the order an average player might like to true form cats requiring Elder Fruit and Epic Seeds, which are quite limited at the beginning of UL when they are first unlocked. Your mileage may vary and use your own judgement to adjust the list to your own situation where it differs from most.

Thanks to all Trusted+ roles who contributed to discussions in creating this list as well as FlowerSnek for doing proofreading and data input work.
