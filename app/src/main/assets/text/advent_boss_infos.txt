271|Queen B stands at 999 range with 888~1332 LD. She inflicts Guaranteed permaslow and has a 3.3s attack frequency, with 12k damage per attack. You need at least 9 speed to enter her blindspot [unless you're luring]. She is Alien / Floating.
493|Queen Mother V has the same range and attack frequency as Queen B, but inflicts Curse instead of Slow.
317|Daboo of the Dead is an omnistrike pusher boss, with a standing range of 300 and a maximum range of 800. He has an enormous 3 million HP with just three knockbacks. On top of that, he has immunity to most status effects, making him a big slowly pushing wall. He deals 30000 damage every 13s, which can one-shot meatshields and a lot of other units. Worst of all, he inflicts a crippling 10s long Slow to anything he hits, making it more difficult to get to him.
492|Heavenly Herald Papuu [Angel] deals 4000 Damage per hit, with 40% extra toxic damage on top of it. With her tremendous omni range, she'll be almost always hitting your base. She strengthens to 3x at 30% HP, becoming much more deadly. She also has immunities to every negative effect except Curse and Sniper KB, both of which greatly debilitate her.
257|King Wahwah stands at 600 range with omni-strike up till 1000. He deals 24000 damage per attack cycle distributed into three equal multi-hits. He has a million HP with 25 KBs, making him relatively easy to knock back [if you can reach him]. All his attacks have guaranteed KB effect. Lastly, he's pretty slow, with just 5 Speed.
506|Everlord Wanwan has omni and multihit, with the same build as Lord Wahwah. The difference being, his third hit carries a one-minute long Warp instead of knockback; and does only 1500 damage.
232|Cruel Angel Clionel stands at 600 range, with an LD reach of 400~1200. She deals 32000 Damage in a single hit, and attacks every 4.8s. She has 2.4M HP with just 4 KBs. While her blindspot is large, she's almost always featured with support enemies which fill it up, making her a forbidable foe.
511|Death Angel Z-Onel retains the LD reach and attack cycle of Clionel, but now has the Zombie trait instead. She also revives infinite times at 50% HP, and has 1M base HP.This means that she can be quite troublesome if you can't Z-Kill her.
431|Bakoo is a Black enemy with 180 standing range, an LD attack ranging from 50 to 1850, freeze with 177% uptime, a 2.83s attack frequency, and 10000 damage. To compensate, she has a very low 4 Speed, and 500k HP with 10 KBs [putting her at a relatively low endurance of 50k].
514|Doremi has the same LD range as Bakoo, but is Traitless. Additionally, she's considerably faster (14 as opposed to Bakoo's 4), and has higher endurance, much more damage, and a slow instead of freeze proc.
267|Hannya is a red variant of The Face, with an enormous 800 range. She also cripples all units to 25% Attack with her weaken, and has an attack frequency of 5s. She deals 36k damage with one attack, which can one-shot many units, including Awakened Bahamut.
491|Black Okame is a Red / Black variant of Hannya. And before you even try it, she is Freeze Immune. She has 320 Standing Range with omnistrike up till 800. With 24000 damage and a 2.1s attack frequency, she can disable most units that aren't tankers. Even slow bulky units like Island or Pizza struggle because of the knockback. Finally, she has 2.6M HP with just a single knockback, which means you aren't killing her before peons stop cycling [without insane Ubercarry at least].
585|Sathankhamun VIII is an Aku variant of Hannya. He wields 650 standing range with omnistrike up till 800. He has 34000 damage per hit and inflicts slow of 2 seconds. His attack frequency is 4.3s. While Sathankhamun is an Aku enemy, he does not have any Aku Shield. That being said, he's still a nasty pusher.
573|Possessed Empress Cat has a range and attack cycle similar to Nyandam Variants. While Evil Emperor has access to surge, Empress attacks with mini-waves. She also has a practically unbreakable 1.2M HP shield, with 980K HP and 10 KBs.
535|Evil Emperor Cat has a range and attack cycle similar to Nyandam Variants. However, he also has a Level 3 Surge [600~900 range] with a debilitating status effect. He inflicts Freeze for 1.5s [reset by surge], and curse for 4s. The damage from the surge isn't that much [6.7k per hit]. He has 520 standing range with omni-strike that goes till 620. He's somewhat fast for a Nyandam variant with 6 speed and very little backswing. He has 1.2M HP and 8 KBs, so he's relatively easy to push back if you have a clean hit.
495|Kappy stands at 230 range, and deals a devastating 38k damage with each attack. To make matters worse, he has a Level 1 Surge [150~750 range]. He has a decent foreswing [40f], and it's not too difficult to make him miss. If you do lose your stack though, he's going to push a lot due to his 14 Speed. He's traitless, and takes quite a long time to kill [2M HP, 6 KBs].
479|Puffsley's Comet has a similar build to Brollow, with big damage [40k], full backswing cooldown, and a high KB count [400]. It has 900k HP, with a standing range of 200 and omni-strike till 500. It also has a guaranteed chance to Knockback all units, although this isn't very relevant as there are few cats with above 40k endurance.
