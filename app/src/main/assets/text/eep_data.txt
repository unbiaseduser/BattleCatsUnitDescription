152|0|Slapsticks have really good AoE DPS, are very cost efficient, and have the range to take on units like M. Ost too. It's the only somewhat spammable anti-Relic on this aboutList, and is brought to a significant fraction of late game stages as either an anti-Relic specialist or just a good stackable area attacker. Talents further cement its place in the late game meta. An easy first choice.
