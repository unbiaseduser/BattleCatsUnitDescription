Suntan Cat (Macho Suntan Cat) is a clone of the basic Macho Cat but with a 50% chance to Dodge Traitless for 1s and 1 KB to help it perform its role as a meatshield. This comes with the drawbacks of a long 5.2s Cooldown so it cannot be spammed, and 330 cost so that you usually wouldn't be able to afford to spam it even with Research Up combos. While its Dodge chance is very high, Suntan is underwhelming in almost all situations due to having nothing to fall back on when the Dodge does fail, wasting a lot of time and cash as its HP is far too low to survive anything other than EoC peons. At best, with some good RNG on your side, it may help as a filler meatshield in Traitless-heavy stages such as No Return Flights if your regular meatshields are underleveled or otherwise can't quite stall the enemies alone.
