Viking Cat, or Thor Cat in Evolved form, is a below average anti-Red with the Strong ability. It boasts 26k effective HP with 525 cost, 4s Cooldown and 3 KBs. Thor Cat's main flaws are its overly high cost and cooldown to work as a meatshield, and low endurance due to 3 KBs. Crazed Whale often performs better as a bulky anti-Red due to better offensive stats and cost efficiency.

In True Form, Maximum the Fighter (MtF) has 65k effective HP against Red and gains Area Attack. Although the HP increase is respectable, MtF still suffers from insufficient endurance as Red enemies can hit rather hard as you progress. Even with a substantial investment of catseyes, plus levels or HP talents, MtF is rarely, if ever, a satisfactory choice and you will have better options. One exception may be in 4 Crown SoL where your options are more limited.
