Salon Cat (Paris Cat) is a good stackable general-use Midrange attacker with 1000 DPS, 350 range and a 2.2s Cooldown. Paris replaces Sexy/Macho Legs Cat in a sense, with the same range but Area Attack and better DPS. Thanks to this, Paris shines throughout basically all of early game as an accessible but highly effective attacker. However, with a cost of 900 and a very fast cooldown, Paris can quickly end up draining your wallet if you're not careful.

In True Form, Cyborg Cat's DPS increases to 1300 and she gains Weaken Immunity. Not much has changed, she does the same job as before but better. But now, as you progress more into mid-game, her cost efficiency issues become more of an issue; Cameraman and Drama serve similar roles as AoE DPS while being more cost efficient so they are often preferable. Cyborg does however have a range advantage over Cameraman, letting her work on (for example) R. Osts. Thanks to this, Cyborg maintains some relevance in the mid-to-late-game in key stages like Heaven's Oasis and Ogre Island, though she ultimately falls more or less out of use once you unlock Slapstick Cats in late game. Cyborg does however shine once again when you later tackle 4 Crown SoL.
