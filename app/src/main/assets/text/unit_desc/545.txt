Phantom Cat (Miasma Cat) is a useless Midranger, with 6000 HP and 2 KBs, 700 DPS, a standing range of 360 while hitting a range of 275 to 500, 675 cost and 14.53s cooldown. It does Massive Damage to Angels, and is both Freeze and Weaken Immune. What heavily hinders it are very low stats of HP, DPS and range for its role. Even towards Angels, the trait it should specialize against, it has 3000 DPS with full anti-Angel treasures, which is just slightly higher than what general LD attackers like Fiend and talented Housewife have. Its immunities are useless as it won't survive if the enemy reaches it. Overall, a dysfunctional unit.
