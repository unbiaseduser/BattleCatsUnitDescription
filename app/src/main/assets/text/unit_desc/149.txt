Mer-Cat (Commando Cat) is a terrible cat. With only 190 standing range and Single Target, she is essentially useless. True Form this unit before using it.

The True Form, Cameraman Cat, goes up to 250 range and gains Area Attack. Now with the range and AoE needed to be a relevant midrange attacker, Camera does great with 1600 DPS and 3.87s Cooldown with 540 cost, allowing you to quickly and cost-effectively stack up considerable amounts of power against any melee-range enemies. Camera is also Strong against Floating, with 2400 effective DPS (2900 with ItF treasures) that easily tears through Bun Bun variants, Brollows, etc. A solid 19.4k effective HP with 4 KBs and a 50% survive chance also help keep Camera stacks alive for a long time. Her slow speed sometimes makes her uncomfortable to use but also helps with stacking. With her Survive talent unlocked, Camera gains 100% survive chance and becomes a viable general pseudo-meatshield, bolstering your defenses while also keeping your DPS stack around longer, making it a high priority to unlock. Her Critical talent gives a rather negligible 2% chance to Critical Hit, but when helped with Crit Rate Up combos, a large stack of Cameras can be useful support on Metal stages too, occasionally turning the tide of battle with a rare-but-powerful AoE critical hit.
