Thief Cat (Phantom Thief Cat) is a bad spammable Single Target attacker with the Double Money ability. However, he is useless because of his terrible stats.

In True Form, even though Goemon Cat gains Area Attack and improved stats, this is not enough to make him significantly helpful. He is therefore still useless outside of hyper-niche rush strats that will not concern the majority of players.
