Actress Cat (Mother Cat) is an awful stackable AoE midranger. In most regards it is a carbon copy of Sexy Legs Cat, but with a higher cost (900) and Area Attack. Its pathetically low 400 DPS and high cost make it completely unusable, and it is always recommended to instead use Paris Cat, who has the exact same stats except more than double the DPS. Actress Cat's True Form, Beefcake Cat, has a much higher 11k HP and an improved 600 DPS thanks to a faster attack rate. This DPS still falls far short of Paris, so despite Beefcake having a little more HP, it remains unusable.

With talents, Beefcake Cat gains the usual 80% stat increases to reach 20k HP and 1100 DPS, as well as a +50% Strengthen at 33% HP and Surge Immunity. The Attack Up talent brings its DPS on par with Paris Cat but still a little short of Cyborg Cat; however the HP talent makes it more than twice as durable as Cyborg. Further adding the Strengthen talent, however, allows it to even exceed Cyborg's DPS at low HP. While this is all nice, it is not worth such NP investment just to get a tankier Cyborg, and it is instead Surge Immunity which makes talented Beefcake interesting. Surge stages usually prevent you from stacking midrange AoE attackers, but by investing in Beefcake's talents you can make this strategy possible again. At a minimum, the Attack Up talent should be invested in alongside Surge Immunity to make its DPS respectable, with Strengthen being an optional improvement and HP Up being handy for being able to stay alive longer post-Strengthen.
