Rocker Cat (Artist Cat) is a highly effective anti-Angel meatshield with the Resistant ability. It has 51k effective HP against Angels with 1 KB, 3.87s Cooldown and 315 cost. This huge HP and low cooldown lets it easily stall early game Angels, proving very useful on ItF stages which mix in hard-hitting Angels like Floating Continent, and in early Angel-containing SoL stages.

In True Form, Ramen Cat reaches 71.4k effective HP against Angels (89.3k with ItF treasures). As you progress through the game, Angels become more and more powerful to the point where this level of durability is almost required to withstand them, making Ramen essentially the most important unit in the anti-Angel meta. Swarms of Angelic Gories will easily melt through other meatshields, and longer-ranged Angels like Sleipnir are very hard to keep in check without Ramen's bulk. Angel-heavy stages like Broken Mask will give you a lot of trouble without Ramen. As an added bonus, Ramen has a surprisingly high 3100 DPS for a meatshield, which allows it to deal substantial chip damage to enemies that it can endure for at least a decent while. Along with his sizable 17.9k base HP, this enables some general use outside of Angels as a tanker at very high levels, particularly in 4 Crown restrictions (Li'l Axe/Dragon/Titan Awakens, etc). His general use is however strictly only in this limited fashion, though, due to too high cost and cooldown to compete with general meatshields most of the time. Finally, his Resist Curse talent lets him remain mostly effective in often-difficult late-game Relic+Angel stages, and his Resist Knockback talent has some limited use to tank and chip Angelic Sleipnir.
