Neneko is a bad Critical Hitter. Due to low health and damage, low 15% crit chance, single target, and a very long cooldown, she is unusable as a critter. You can obtain better Critical Hitters very early in the game instead (Space Cat/Jurassic Cat). However, she has the redeeming quality of having an Attack Up Sm combo with Moneko, which can be useful in some stages where higher damage per hit is needed to let something like A.Bahamut one-hit kill or one-hit KB enemies for a successful rushdown.
