Catway (Drone Cat) is a niche Midrange attacker with the Strong ability against Red, Black and Angel enemies. It has 1500 AoE DPS at 355 Range, 6200 HP with 3 KBs, a 7.9s Cooldown and 1200 cost. Against non-target traits it is a direct downgrade of Drama Cats, with less DPS and much worse HP for a higher cost and cooldown, making it not viable in general use. In particular, Drone's pitiful HP is not enough to keep a stack reliably alive in tricky stages. However, against Red, Black, and Angel its Strong-enhanced effective 2600 DPS and 15.5k HP make it a formidable, decently durable, and cost effective stackable attacker. Despite this, more dedicated specialists such as Pizza Cat against Black will often take care of these traits more effectively. Drone's ability to target multiple traits, at least, can still give it an advantage on stages like Pecking Order with a mixture of its target traits. It is also a member of the Research Up M combo Aerial Recon, which can be effective if youâ€™re lacking better Research combos and bringing Drone anyway.

In True Form, Time Traveller Cat gains a more usable 10.6k HP (26.6k effective) and DPS of 2200 (3900 effective). Time Traveller is viable as a general attacker in midgame now, with durability on par with Drama and better DPS. In lategame, however, it falls behind again as Slapsticks becomes available with far superior general stats. Late game also presents stronger enemy threats which Time Traveller cannot keep up with, often even against his traits as they are paired with Curse-using Relics. Time Traveller is still therefore mainly used as AoE DPS solely against its traits where it comfortably outperforms generalists in its range class. A notable example is Aku Realms Mexico, where a stack of Time Travellers is a good way to cut through the spam of Gabriels.
