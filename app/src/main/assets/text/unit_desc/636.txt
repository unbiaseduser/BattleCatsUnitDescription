Brainwashed Tank Cat (Brainwashed Wall Cat) is a clone of the regular Eraser Cat with just 8500 base HP, but with the added ability of Resistant against Traitless (34k effective HP). As well as coming with 210 cost and a 4s Cooldown, Brainwashed Wall also has 14 speed, faster than regular Eraser but slower than the Manic version. Despite an excessively long Cooldown for a meatshield, its large anti-Traitless bulk means it still provides more HP per second than even a modestly higher level regular Eraser (Lv 30/40/50 Brainwashed Wall roughly matches Lv 50/60/100 Eraser), and so can replace it in pure Traitless stages, especially when assisted by Research combos to alleviate the long Cooldown. However, its poor base HP means on mixed or general stages, it is a waste of cash and Cooldown to use this cat.
