Gold Cat is a meatshield with 75 cost and a 2s cooldown. He is a carbon copy of the basic Cat and therefore performs all the same functions. It is always nice to have an extra cheap meatshield for stages where you need many, but it does not distinguish itself in any other way.

In True Form, Glittering Macho Cat gains Wave Immunity, making him the first ever Wave Immune 75c meatshield. While this is far from needed in the current meta where we already have plenty of Wave Immune units that make life easy, Gold can still be a very useful extra line of defense, reducing the reliance on more expensive pseudo-meatshields such as Catley and Teamaster. While he still dies in a single hit and by extension can't perfectly stall Wave stages, it is still a no-brainer to swap out your Mohawk for Gold Cat on any Wave stages.
