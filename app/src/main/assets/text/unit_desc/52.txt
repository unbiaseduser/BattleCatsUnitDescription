Shaman Cat, or Necromancer Cat in Evolved Form, is a stackable anti-Floating unit with a 20% chance to Freeze for 2s. He has 250 range, 5.87s of Cooldown and a 1.8s attack frequency. His low Freeze chance and Single Target make his CC inconsistent, though this can be worked around by stacking many copies of him. This can be of limited use in early-game if you lack better options, such as against Bun Bun and on the easier Cyclone stages. More importantly, Necromancer Cat is one half of the combo Bony Bone with Skelecat, which is a very important Research combo often paired with Biohazard (aka BioBone) to get two Research combos in 3 slots.

In True Form, Necro-Dancer Cat's range goes up to 300 and he gets an increase in Freeze duration to 3s. This would make him a somewhat useful anti-Floating CC unit but unfortunately, Sanzo Cat (Bishop True Form) completely overshadows Necro in this role. Despite Necro having more range, and Freeze being more powerful than Slow, Sanzo's higher uptime and Area Attack make it much more effective in practice. Necro's range advantage rarely makes a difference as there are very few additional Floating enemies that this lets him outrange. Wave talent looks good on paper but the chance of a Wave and Freeze on the same hit is too low. Typically, the only times you'll use Necro are against Mecha-Bun (who Sanzo barely outranges) and when youâ€™re bringing Necro for the combo anyway, such as in Floor 34 of Heavenly Tower.
