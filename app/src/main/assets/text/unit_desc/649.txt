Wargod Hanzo is a backline attacker who targets Black and Floating and has Colossus Killer. He comes with 61.2k HP and 4 KBs, 4600 DPS at 450 range and abilites of Massive Damage and a 1.67s Freeze on a 4.23s attack frequency. He is also Immune to Freeze and Slow, costs 5325 and respawns every 145s.

Hanzo's fast attack cycle makes him reliable at delivering close to his theoretical DPS; even if on paper he looks about on par with Pre-TF Ururun or C.Bahamut, his much smoother attack cycle does not leak DPS to missed hits like especially the latter of those. His solid HP and KB count keeps him on the field longer than those two No Gacha backliners, though it does come at a slightly higher deploy cost. Massive Damage to Black and Floating lets him do well against backliners of those traits alone, but his Freeze also keeps weaker peons out of the way for a moment, and creates vulnerabilities for your other units to exploit.

Unfortunately, Black and Floating are perhaps the two traits which least need a Massive Damage / Freeze backliner as the usual lineup of Rare and Super Rare options, plus Bombercat, almost perfectly takes care of these niches. Further to this, his Freeze is extremely short with less than half uptime, making it little more than a bonus. Colossus Killer is a small stat boost, not enough to keep up with the immense stats of Colossal enemies at least, but even if it were stronger he lacks the range to actually work against Le'Grim or Megamooth regardless so it wouldn't matter. Similarly being Freeze and Slow Immune is odd considering the lack of significant Black and Floating enemies exploiting these effects.

While Hanzo is far from awful and new players might find him useful, he has nothing to really stand out from the wide range of regular anti-Black/Floating cats, and only barely stands out above Ururun Wolf as a general backline attacker (and is completely obsoleted by its True Form in late game).
