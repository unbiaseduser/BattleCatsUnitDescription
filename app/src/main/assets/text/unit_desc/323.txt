Miyamoku Musashi is a bad Backliner with Wave Immunity. He has 32.3k HP, 3600 DPS, 3 KBs, 5 Speed, 8.97s attack frequency, 4800 cost and 151s cooldown. In True Form, Awakened Musashi gains increased stats with 42.5k HP and 4700 DPS, 30% chance to Freeze Relics for 3s, Zombie Killer and Curse Immunity.

Musashi is the most easily accessible Wave Immune Backliner in the game and has sufficient stats to function against Wave enemies. His high damage per hit also gives him some value against low-endurance enemies, and synergizes well with Z-Kill in True Form.

Musashi is a bad unit for a few reasons. In general, he has a rather long foreswing that causes him to often miss and not provide much help, which paired with his low DPS and minimal range for a Backliner makes him very replaceable, being outclassed by Ururun Wolf as a generalist. In True Form, his Freeze Relic ability is very unreliable due to a low 33% uptime and low proc chance. As Zombies are infamous for their burrow ability, a unit with long foreswing, few KBs and long recharge such as Musashi fares poorly against them. Lastly, his role as an anti-Wave unit is outperformed by Talented Dancer Cat and most Ubers of this class due to Musashi's bare minimum stats, being easily ignored once you unlock any of those.

In conclusion, Musashi fails in all roles other than being barely passable as a Wave Immune attacker, and is usable for this if you have no other options.
