Onmyoji Cat (Magica Cat) is a situationally effective CC unit with 310 range, Single Target, 11.87s cooldown, 510 cost, and 50% chance to Weaken non-Metal enemies to 50% power for 6.67s. While permaweakening enemies is potentially very strong, especially against Traitless with few other counters, Magica's Single Target means she often can't hit the intended target, and even when she can the 50% proc chance leaves the success of this strategy ultimately to chance. Furthermore, a long cooldown prevents easy stacking to get around this weakness and her slow 93f foreswing also gives the target plenty of time to interrupt her. Nonetheless, in the right situation such as against R. Ost or Crazed Cat variants, this Weaken effect can be one of few control options available to the early-to-mid game player, allowing your meatshields to stall these aggressive enemies a lot easier.

In True Form, Thaumaturge Cat gets a much needed 100% proc chance, allowing her to inflict permaweaken reliably and consistently, reducing the need to rely on luck and/or stacking to use her effectively. Additionally, Thaumaturge gains complete Immunity to Waves with talents. This expands Thauma's matchups to include almost every Wave enemy in the game, helping the rest of your lineup survive their annoying wave attacks. Wave Blockers like Octopus are often preferable to this as they completely nullify the wave instead, but in late game Thaumaturge can instead work alongside your Wave Blocker to keep it alive longer despite the presence of increasingly hard-hitting wave attackers.
