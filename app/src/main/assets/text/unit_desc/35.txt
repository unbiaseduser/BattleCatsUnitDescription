Nerd Cat (Hacker Cat) is a niche LD Super Backliner with 1200 range, an attack frequency of about 8s and a Cooldown of 158s. In First Form it is not useful due to Single Target, but in Evolved Form it gains Area Attack and deals 600 DPS to enemies within its LD range of 800 to 1200. While this pathetic DPS makes it irrelevant in regular stages, Hacker Cat can be used effectively against super-high-range enemies that kill all your other cats, such as Crazed Bird and Crazed Lizard, as you can stack multiple Hackers over the course of a long endurance battle to slowly whittle away at the enemy. It is however vital to keep foes away from your Hacker stack, as it is extremely fragile and will die as soon as anything touches it.

In True Form, Cyberpunk Cat gains the ability to Slow all non-Metal enemies for 2s. This expands its role to be one of the most broken CC units in the game, as now a stack of Cyberpunks can permanently Slow almost anything, often being the best option for handling late-game stages with enemies who are difficult to otherwise stall. With talents, Cyberpunk's Slow duration can be increased to 4s. The effect of this is twofold. First, a single talented Cyberpunk can now provide decent support against mixed-trait enemies by itself, with 50% to 60% uptime depending on treasures. Second, fewer Cyberpunks must be stacked to achieve a permanent Slow effect. Its Survive talent is more niche, but also useful should you wish to use Cyberpunk in certain stages with high range waves such as Clan of the Maniacs, or in hard-pushing mixed trait stages such as Cosmic Juggernaut, to at least let it reposition once.
