Kung Fu Cat (Drunken Master Cat) is a poor spammable Midranger. He has 15.3k HP with 1 KB, 2900 DPS with a three-part multihit, 20.6k Damage, 300 Range, 20s Cooldown and 2250 cost. In True Form, Dancer Cat goes up to 330 Range and loses multihit in favor of a single high damage attack. With poor all-around stats, Dancer finds no usage outside 4 Crown, being easily replaceable by other Midrange options like Cyborg and Drama. Even within 4 Crown he finds little usage, with his one main upside being decent burst damage and endurance making him able to be utilized on Li'l Jamiera and Li'l King Dragon.

With talents, Dancer is significantly improved and even gains a new niche, with Attack Up and Wave Immunity being the main talents for Dancer. Attack Up boosts Dancer’s lackluster 2900 DPS to a much better 5300 DPS, making Dancer a viable option as a generalist Midranger even outside of 4 Crown, and in 4 Crown he becomes near game-breaking. This, when combined with Wave Immunity, gives Dancer an entirely new niche as an anti-Wave attacker, being one of the best even when including Ubers. Apart from these main talents, HP Up and Surge attack are also decent options. Surge can occasionally deal very high damage to backliner enemies and deal additional damage to enemies that were knocked back by Dancer’s initial hit. HP Up, while not too useful given Dancer’s 1KB, sometimes lets him land one more hit, which can be enough with Dancer’s high damage, and even allows him to tank and reach enemies he usually couldn't.
