Valentine's Neneko is a bad Critical Hitter. She has 100% chance to create a Level 2 Mini-Wave but has low health, low damage, an unreliable 10% crit chance, Single Target, and an excessively long cooldown. You can obtain more useful general-purpose critical hitters very early in the game (Space Cat/Jurassic Cat). As Mini-Waves only do 20% of her already poor damage, her occasional wave+crit attacks are not helpful except against swarms of Metal peons such as Metal Doges, though Catyphoon is vastly more reliable for this.

In True Form, True Love Neneko gains a 20% chance to pierce Aku Shields. Her stats and cooldown remain awful and, to make things worse, she is outranged by every single relevant Shielded Aku enemy, requiring a stepping stone to use her Mini-Wave in order to even hit anything. Pied Piper or Aku Researcher are preferable to use over her in essentially every situation as Shield Piercers. Her absurdly high TF cost (1 Golden Fruit, 1 Gold Seed) combined with this poor performance means Valentine's Neneko is exclusively a collector's item and not a serious unit.
