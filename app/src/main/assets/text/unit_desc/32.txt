Hip Hop Cat (Dancing Flasher Cat) is a decent single target Melee attacker with anti-Red CC capabilities. It has 25.5k HP, 25.5k Damage and 3.9k DPS with 220 range. These stats are great for the low 675 cost and fast 12.5s cooldown, particularly the huge damage per hit, making it useful in Early Game to cripple melee-range enemies. Single target, sluggish foreswing and low range hinder it from putting these immense stats to wider use, however. With a 40% chance to Slow Red enemies for 4s, Dancing Flasher is a great option for early-game Bores and Red Cyclone should you have nothing better.

Can Can Cat now has 38.3k HP, 38.3k Damage (5.9k DPS), 60% proc chance, and Warp Immunity. With these improvements, Can Can boasts nearly Uber-class stats, becoming a cost-efficient and dominant melee attacker with the power and durability to work in many key stages despite its weaknesses, such as Parade of the Dead, Floor 47 and Z-Onel. Can Can only gets better after this, with some of the best talents in the game. Double Money stands out as the most important talent, synergizing well with the high damage per hit to reliably snipe peons and make cash-tight startoffs go a lot more smoothly. Additionally, its Speed Up talent (increasing speed from 11 to 21) lets Can Can work as a cheap, high damage rusher and Target Alien is nice for Melee Aliens in CotC (e.g Star Peng, Nimoy Bore) especially given Can Can's Warp Immunity. Can Can's high power and durability make it a great candidate for boosting with catseyes, as well as unlocking stat talents, letting it remain relevant for the entire game.
