Black Zeus is an excellent ranged attacker and Sniper with 76.5k HP, 3 KBs, around 4500 base DPS with a 4 second foreswing and 10 second attack cycle, 455 standing range and LD covering 300 to 700. Most interestingly, he has the ability to deal Insane Damage (x5 DPS) to Traitless enemies, and has Weaken Immunity.

Black Zeus has nice range, with enough standing range to not need a stepping stone for his LD, but the potential to hit very deep into the enemy backline when given one thanks to his 245 piercing range. His DPS is above average for an LD attacker in his range class. With his Insane Damage ability, he reaches a massive 23k effective LD DPS against Traitless enemies. Recurring Traitless threats such as Master A, R. Ost, THE SLOTH, and Otters are completely obliterated. Longer ranged ones like Camelle can be sniped into oblivion with a stepping stone. The multitude of Traitless bosses in the game (Manics, Yulala, etc) are largely done away with effortlessly. In general use, his DPS is somewhat low for a standard Backliner, but is more than enough to work well as a Sniper, a role in which he's unusually bulky, with high HP and a passable KB count.

One of the main weaknesses of Black Zeus would be his very long foreswing and attack cycle. While he is an LD attacker, so accuracy is rarely a problem, having a long foreswing and a long attack frequency can hurt in many situations where he may be interrupted, or offer melee peons / fast pushers a chance to infiltrate his sizable blindspot. Good meatshielding and support can reduce this issue, but not fully avoid it in harder stages.

While Black Zeus's weaknesses can hurt a lot, his rare ability to effectively counter Traitless enemies as a whole is very strong, with some serious LD DPS in this niche. His general sniping potential is solid too, with great range and unusual bulk that occasionally comes in handy.
