Stilts Cat, or Totem Cat in Evolved Form, is a bad anti-Angel KB unit with 310 Range, Single Target, 8.5s Cooldown, and a 30% chance to KB Angel every 2.5s. Totem quickly proves itself to be mostly worthless due to several issues. In the first place, the KB ability is redundant against high-KB Count enemies like Angelic Gory, while bulkier Angels mostly outrange it. Single Target further dooms Totem to irrelevancy as most Angel stages heavily spam peons that will get in the way. Totem's only real use is to tackle Divine Cyclone whose pushing power, low range, and 1 KB make Totem's ability to gain ground against it valuable.

Its True Form, Acrobat Cats has a better 50% chance to proc. This does nothing to solve its problems. In the very late game, eventually one relevant enemy appears, though; St. Dober, who much like Divine Cyclone has the combination of high endurance and low range but high attack power, making Acrobats an ideal counter. Note, however, that in the presence of a backline enemy behind St. Dober, this can instead cause you to push into their range and get killed. While Acrobats have seemingly powerful talents such as Wave Immunity and Surge Attacks, there are so few situations to use Acrobats that they are wasted on it and not very worthwhile investments. At best these talents allow Acrobat Cats to surge-KB Angel backliners along with the frontline (limiting their suicidal issues) or function in stages like Banana Genomes and Baron Mr. Angel.
