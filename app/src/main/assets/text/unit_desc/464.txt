Dogumaru is an average Midranger with the core ability of Resist vs Traitless as well as immunities to Warp and Curse. Dogumaru has 81.6k HP with 2 KBs, 5400 DPS at 350 range, 3900 cost and 104.5s Cooldown. It has 15 speed and a 3.4s foreswing.

Dogumaru fills a very hard-to-replace niche of an anti-Traitless Tanker. With an effective 326.4k HP (163.2k Endurance) providing it more than enough bulk to hold off most Traitless threats and a decent 15 speed to reach the frontline promptly, it becomes a staple of many late 4-Crown SoL Traitless stages, such as No Return Flights. While Warp Immunity may initially seem useless, it can work against Yulala on Floors 40 and 49.

While Dogumaru can shine vs Traitless, outside of them it is a very subpar unit. While its base HP is among the highest of non-gacha units, it is still not enough to function as a general tank, and 5400 DPS is just not enough to make it worth using when not also benefiting from its bulk, as late game Backliners like Awakened Ururun deliver more DPS from a safer range. Even within its niche the addition of Jagando as another 4-Crown anti-Traitless Midranger, but with much more firepower, reduces the novelty of Dogumaru's role. Furthermore, its long foreswing is suboptimal for a Midranger who is naturally going to be interrupted sometimes due to their high risk role. Similarly, the Cooldown is a little on the long side for a unit you expect to be under constant fire and inevitably die.

Dogumaru is decent at what it does, but fails at almost everything else, which is especially bad for how late in the game you get it. Despite this, Dogumaru is still given the opportunity to shine in 4-Crown SoL due to the relative uniqueness of its niche.
