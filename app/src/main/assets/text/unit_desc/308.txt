Gardener Cat (Lumbercat) is a semi-stackable anti-Zombie CC unit that can Freeze Zombies for 2s from 200 range. This only has a 5% proc rate, but it tries to make up for quality with quantity by attacking rapidly, every 0.3s. Despite its fast attack rate, 5% is truly awful and makes it inconsistent and luck-based to land the first Freeze, and then land another one before it wears off. With 11.2s of cooldown, it is also time consuming to build a large enough stack to get around this issue, and it is very fragile with 8500 HP, so your stack might suddenly be wiped out by an unburrowing Zombie before they can Freeze it at any moment. Gardener can hence provide only limited support against Zombies, but is better than nothing.

The True Form, Weedwacker Cat, now Freezes for 4s from 250 range. The longer Freeze duration makes it easier for Weedwacker to maintain a Freeze once it starts by giving it twice as long to land the next proc, leading to more consistent support against tougher Zombies like Dread Bore who only need to be unfrozen for a very brief moment to shred through your defenses, as well as keeping the likes of Big Sal under control and not letting them burrow past your stack. It now also has a decent 17k health to endure a stray hit from burrowing/reviving Zombies better. Its Target Aku talent is of limited use as Shielded Akus are immune to CC and it has few good matchups against unshielded Akus.
