Note that all levels 1-50 are show regardless of if specific cats in this XP Curve can actually reach that level.

Cats that can go above Level 30 require 1 Catseye of the relevant rarity per level up to Level 45, after which 2 catseyes are needed. See advice on which cats are best to boost beyond level 30 at [Hypermax Priority](app://sixty.nine/hypermaxpriority)
